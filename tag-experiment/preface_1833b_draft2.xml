            <lb/>Some of the allusions to the West

            <lb/>colonial property. The resident planters,
            <lb/>the attorneys, the managers are here
            <lb/>intended: Let the records of the "Colonial
            <lb/>Chruch Union," and many of the speeches

            <lb/>&amp; then say if any langauge can be
            <lb/>too severe.
            <lb/>Should this little volume in any way

            <lb/>the sympathy of late so widely excited
