            <lb/>the pledge of peace.

            <lb/>more than seven years ago, when the state

            <lb/>the thoughts &amp; feelings of the British nation on

         <ab>To those who at first sight may think

            <lb/>suppressed, the Compiler ventures to suggest
            <lb/>that even if the appointed apprenticeship of
            <lb/>five or seven years were already expired,
            <lb/>yet the past sorrows of the negro, &amp; our
            <lb/>long-continued apathy in disregarding his
            <lb/>bitter griefs, should not be speedily be for-
            <lb/>gotten, but often remembered with deep 
            <lb/>humility before God––"We have been verily
            <lb/>guilty concerning our Brother, in that we
            <lb/>saw the anguish of his soul, when he
