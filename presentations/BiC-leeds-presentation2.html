<h3>A Definitive Object, a Solidity of Purpose</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>&quot;The plan appears to me very promising, and I hope, and that its success will further the amiable design of its formation––as a publication ... which though so attractive to the Eye, and in some of their contributions, so touching to the heart, have always seemed to me as wanting a definitive object, a solidity of purpose...&quot;</em></li>

<h3>Textual transactions</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Many of the poems submitted to Rawson were unchanged. Yet some of the submissions show a significant level of editorial engagement and judgment.</p></li>
<li><p>For example, Rawson received four? submissions from Bernard Barton, two of which began and ended the volume, and two more appeared elsewhere in the volume. This suggests an attention to selection.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="slide section level3">

<ul>
<li><p>Another textual transaction came with Thomas Hill's submission of &quot;Grave of Wilberforce,&quot; a poem that went through several apologies as well as versions.</p></li>
<li><p>He submitted three versions to Rawson. The first fair copy submission is rather interesting, because it includes both minor revisions, as well as a note penciled in at the end of the poem:</p></li>

<li>Another clue left in the manuscripts comes from J. W. H. Pritchard's 26 December 1833 letter to Rawson, suggesting changes to Miss Williams's poem (to which himself provided the title &quot;Voice from the Land of Bondage&quot;).</li>

<h3>Publication History</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>While in many ways <em>BIC</em> was a publication of Northern writers and activists, it was published by Jackson and Walford (St. Paul's Churchyard).</p></li>
<li><p>The book was sold for 12 shillings, about 50 GBP in today's money; about two days pay for a skilled tradesman, or the cost of a week's supply of butchered meat and tea.</p></li>
<li><p>The volume is indeed handsome: foolscap octavo gilt pages, tightly bound in a turkey morocco binding with a gilded engraving of the bow. The advertisement called attention to its quality.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="reception" class="slide section level3">
<h3>Reception</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The publisher, Jackson and Walford (18 St Paul's Church-yard) was also responsible for the <em>Eclectic Review</em>, The <em>Congregational Year Books</em>, and other ecclesiastical books.</p></li>
<li><p>One of the contributors to <em>The Bow in the Cloud</em>, Josiah Conder, had since 1813 been the owner and editor of the <em>Eclectic Review</em>, which also featured a substantial and laudatory review of <em>BIC</em> in its July 1834 issue.</p></li>
<li><p>The periodical also had a wide American readership (it was reprinted Foster, Bisbee, and Co. in New York).</p></li>

<div id="new-discoveries" class="slide section level3">
<h3>New Discoveries</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Rawson chose not to publish every piece she received.</p></li>
<li><p>Perhaps the most important of the rejected pieces comes from Dinah Ball, whose poem glorifying Toussaint L'Ouverture must have been too controversial for a volume largely framed around Christian piety, not the violent revolution that is clearly celebrated in the opening stanzas.</p></li>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Toussaint Louverture.</em> <br/><em>Cast a reflective glance athwart the flood To that bold Isle where prowess and renown Have urged their course through deluges of blood, And snapped the Tyrant's yoke, and scorned his frown.</em> <br/><em>When Europe's unrelenting hand had swayed, With scorpion rod, Domingo's land of slaves, And Negro-vengeance had her deeds repaid By massacres that died the circling waves,</em> <br/><em>Benignant Heaven, in mercy to the oppressed, Nurtured a Hero of the [jitty?] race, This mighty soul with ample views possessed, And stamped with moral dignity his face.</em></p>

<p>The poem encompasses seven manuscript pages, and it is truly a great pity that the poem was left out. For the first time, this edition is publishing this entire poem.</p>
