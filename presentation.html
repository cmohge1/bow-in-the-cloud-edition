<h2>Mary Anne Rawson's <em>The Bow in the Cloud</em> and the Networks of Anti-Slavery Literature</h2>

<h3>A Definitive Object, a Solidity of Purpose</h3>

<p><em>"The plan appears to me very promising, and I hope, and that its success will further the amiable design of its formation––as a publication ... which though so attractive to the Eye, and in some of their contributions, so touching to the heart, have always seemed to me as wanting a definitive object, a solidity of purpose..."</em></p>

<p><em>(Mary Sterndale to Mary Anne Rawson, 28 February 1833?)</em></p>

<p>It turns out that most of Sterndale's literary submissions and suggestions in her letters were not published. Only one poem, "The Slave Ship," was included. Yet Sterndale's characterization of the aims of the Bow in the Cloud might be the most relevant, as well as the most indicative, of the textual history of this astonishing collection of materials.</p>

<h3>Textual transactions</h3>

<p>Many of the poems submitted to Rawson were unchanged. Yet some of the submissions show a significant level of editorial engagement and judgment. For example, Rawson received four? submissions from Bernard Barton, two of which began and ended the volume, and two more appeared elsewhere in the volume. This suggests an attention to selection.</p>

<p>Another textual transaction came with Thomas Hill's submission of "Grave of Wilberforce," a poem that went through several apologies as well as versions. He submitted three versions to Rawson. The final one includes a corrected stanza for “Grave of Wilberforce”, (“Conspicuous…”), with an explanatory footnote, as well as some additional suggestions for changes that were not adopted. The first fair copy submission is rather interesting, because it includes both minor revisions, as well as a note penciled in at the end of the poem:</p>

<p>Here is the note zoomed in:</p>

<p><em>My Dear Mrs Rawson</em></p>

<p><em>I am ashamed of the lateness of my</em></p>

<p><em>offering, &amp; am perfectly conscious of its ...</em></p>

<p>Yet he submitted another fair copy, which included a revision to the stanza beginning "For lo!"</p>

<p>Another clue left in the manuscripts comes from J. W. H. Pritchard's 26 December 1833 letter to Rawson. Pritchard was a contributor to the volume, but in that letter he also played the editor, suggesting changes to Miss Williams's poem (to which himself provided the title "Voice from the Land of Bondage").</p>

<p>Pritchard's next letter from 11 April 1834 is really crucial (see leaf 64 MS414-Box 2). It proves not only that he helped her edit the book, but also that he offered suggestions to Rawson's preface, which were adopted.</p>

<p><em>The sentence might admit of a change of this kind "It would indeed have been delightful if</em> every <em>hand which has taken a prominent part [or been actively employed] in pulling down the prison house, &amp; in striking off the fetters of the bondsmen, could have put &amp;c"</em></p>

<p>Here it was published:</p>

<h3>Publication History</h3>

<p>While in many ways <em>BIC</em> was a publication of Northern writers and activists, it was published by Jackson and Walford (St. Paul's Churchyard).</p>

<p>The book was sold for 12 shillings, about 50 GBP in today's money. Put another way, it was about two days pay for a skilled tradesman, or about the cost of a week's supply of butchered meat and tea. In other words, this was a middle-class product, on the high end of affordability.</p>

<p>The volume is indeed handsome: the foolscap octavo pages were gilt, tightly bound in a turkey morocco binding with a gilded engraving of the bow. The advertisement called attention to its quality.</p>

<h3>Reception</h3>

<p>The publisher, Jackson and Walford (18 St Paul's Church-yard) was also responsible for the <em>Eclectic Review</em>, The <em>Congregational Year Books</em>, and other ecclesiastical books. One of the contributors to <em>The Bow in the Cloud</em>, Josiah Conder, had since 1813 been the owner and editor of the <em>Eclectic Review</em>, which also featured a substantial and laudatory review of <em>BIC</em> in its July 1834 issue. This was a significant, since <em>Eclectic Review</em> was one of the most prestigious literary periodicals of its time, one that not only published prominent romantics but also American authors such as Washington Irving. The periodical also had a wide American readership (it was reprinted Foster, Bisbee, and Co. in New York).</p>
