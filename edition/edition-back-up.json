      { "value" : "&quot;If therefore the Son shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.&quot; -- John viii.36.<br /><br />&quot;En vain on cherche par le moyen des richesses, du credit, de l&#39;autorit\u00e9, des dignit\u00e9s, de l&#39;\u00e9tude, et de la sagesse des philosophes, de s&#39;affranchir de quelque assujetissement, et de quelque servitude; on ne travaille qu&#39;a se faire de nouvelles chaines, quand le croeur n&#39;est point delivr\u00e9 des liens de l&#39;iniquit\u00e9, et de l&#39;esclavage des passions, par l&#39;unique Lib\u00e9rateur, J\u00e9sus-Christ.&quot; -- Quesnel.<br /><br /><br />There is scarcely a poet who has not sung the praises of Liberty, or an orator who has not made it the subject of his warmest eulogiums. The very name is invested with a charm that a thousand splendid associations have combined to render most potent in awakening the slumbering energies of the soul, and rousing it to glorious achievements; so that when liberty is the watchword, every heart is expected to respond to the call, and he would be branded as a dastard who should be backward to enter the lists in her defence. It is probable that one reason why this simple word acts like a magic spell in kindling up the most thrilling emotions, is because it has been employed with such extensive latitude as to embrace within its meaning some of the noblest blessings and privileges that pertain to man. The poet and the philosopher, the peasant and the slave, are alike interested in liberty; and if the one attaches ideas to it which are unthought of by the other, it is because one word has been chosen to designate the dearest rights of the human race, in all conditions and relations, and under all the endlessly diversified circumstances attending upon our present existence.<br /><br />Liberty, in the view of the philosopher, as we may infer from Aristotle&#39;s definition, consists in a man&#39;s living according to his own reason; in not being enslaved by the opinion of others, the prejudices of education, the false glare which dazzles the imagination and imposes upon the heart, and all those enthralling influences by which error and delusion are accustomed to maintain their domination over the mind, and at the same time that they lead it astray, trample upon its liberty, and debase and enfeeble its powers. No one, who is acquainted with the history of the progress of knowledge and science, need be told how long the human intellect was held in the veriest slavery, in consequence of the shackles imposed by ignorance and superstition; what baneful effects resulted from this thraldom; how many desperate struggles were made for freedom; and that among the illustrious individuals who not only sought to disentangle their own minds from the servile track prescribed by former ages, but also to open up to others the true path of science, the highest praise is due to the immortal Bacon. He that would enjoy this rational liberty must claim it for himself; let him assert and exercise his independence; and if he would prove that he belongs not to the <em>servum pecus</em>, let him cast away those fetters that would bind down the soul from an expansive search into all the regions of truth, and prevent the exercise of its right to judge on all subjects within the cognizance of the human mind.<br /><br />Allied to the liberty of man, as a thinking being, is that which respects him as a creature accountable to the supreme moral Governor, and which has been usually termed liberty of conscience. And, -- but that the pen of history has recorded it in a thousand bloody persecutions, and in the expiring agonies of martyrs and confessors; and but that events in our own times add painful confirmation to the monstrous fact, and shew us that nothing is too vile for fallen humanity, we could scarcely believe that any one could ever dare to the presumption that usurps the sole and undivided prerogative of God, or presume to dictate to his fellow what religious creed he should embrace, what views he must entertain of his moral duties, and with what services he ought to approach his Maker! Happily the death-blow has been given to this species of slavery in our own country; but not until many a heart had been broken with suffering, and many a crime committed, over which the mantle of concealment shall never be thrown, that they may be held up to everlasting reproach and execration.<br /><br />But the liberty which has been most frequently the theme of universal commendation is that which belongs to man as a member of civil society, and which claims for him an exemption from all unjust and oppressive conditions. For this, heroes have fought and patriots have bled; while mankind, who have reaped the fruits of their bravery, have not been sparing in rewarding them with the well-earned meed of praise. So long as the records of the past shall be preserved, their fame will live, and their names be transmitted down to posterity with eternal honour.<br /><br />It appears, then, that liberty is defined and measured according to the nature and extent of the slavery which it destroys, and the peculiar character of those rights which it confirms; and must, therefore, be the greatest blessing to those who have suffered the most deeply under wrong, and been most degraded by their bondage. Now there is a form of slavery so atrocious and diabolical that language falters in expressing the villany in which it originated, the wickedness by which it is supported, and the tremendous evils that it inflicts; and to the disgrace and shame of humanity, it yet remains to be annihilated. How long shall the wrongs of Africa continue unredressed, and the groans of her captive sons be disregarded? Surely the time is come to remove the foulest stain that can attach itself to the character of a free and enlightened people; and if justice, and humanity, and even political expediency, deserve to be respected, the immediate emancipation of the Negro is already virtually decreed. It cannot be deferred; -- either the British Legislature, or the enslaved themselves, taught to know their power, and determined to vindicate their rights, and aided by that God who has declared himself to be the foe of the oppressor, will soon decide the question, whether these injured sufferers shall recover their station in society or not, and whether the myriads who have never refused to recognize the Negro as a brother, shall not at length have to hail him as restored to the rank and dignity of a free-man.<br /><br />Surely if so many blessings are comprehended under the name of Liberty, we may admit that there *ought* to be a charm in the very sound, and that it is the term a man should choose to employ when he would point out that which he conceived to be the dearest and noblest portion he could possess.<br /><br />&quot;But there is <em>yet</em> a liberty, unsung<br />By poets, and by senators unpraised,<br />Which monarchs cannot grant, nor all the powers&nbsp;<br />Of earth and hell confederate take away:<br />A liberty, which persecution, fraud,&nbsp;<br />Oppression, prisons, have no power to bind;&nbsp;<br />Which whoso tastes can be enslaved no more.&nbsp;<br />&#39;Tis <em>liberty</em>&nbsp;of heart derived from Heaven,<br />Bought with His blood who gave it to mankind,&nbsp;<br />And sealed with the same token. It is held<br />By charter, and that charter sanctioned sure,&nbsp;<br />By the unimpeachable and awful oath<br />And promise of a God. His other gifts<br />All bear the royal stamp that speaks them His,<br />And are august, -- but this transcends them all.&quot;<br /><br />A man may be free in every sense but one, and yet be the very vilest slave. His reason may disdain the trammels of vulgar superstition, and be unconfined in the pursuit of worldly science, and yet his understanding may be enslaved by the depraved power of sinful prejudices and pursuits, so as to be incapable of unrestrained exercise in the sublime regions of heavenly Truth; he may be under no external control as to the manner in which he shall pay his homage and duty to the Almighty, and yet be witheld from that reasonable and willing service which God requires, by having a conscience blunted and seared by the unhallowed influence of bad passions and habits; no man may question his absolute right over his own person and property, nor hold over his head the lash of the oppressor; and yet his own lusts may tyrannize in his heart, Satan may hold him as his vassal, and lead him captive at his will; in short, notwithstanding his lofty boasts of freedom, he may, all the while, be the victim of such moral and spiritual bondage as shall fit him to be the wretched prey of remorse in this world, and unutterable misery in that which is to come. This is the slavery &quot;<em>of sin unto death</em>,&quot; which is opposed to &quot;<em>the glorious liberty of the children of God</em>.&quot;<br /><br />The condition of man as a fallen creature, if viewed in the light of the Word of God, is one of extreme guilt, impotency, and wretchedness. A state of mind which is described as being &quot;enmity against God&quot; must necessarily lead to constant acts and habits of transgression. But there is no sin which does not expose to condemnation and death. Hence every man is under the sentence of that law which declares, &quot;the soul that sinneth it shall die.&quot; He stands bound to the threatened punishment, and all the claims to favour and blessing, which he might otherwise have had in consequence of his original relation to God as his creature, have become justly forfeited. At the same time, the dominion of sinful propensities in the heart, and the repetition of sinful acts in the life, have induced a moral incapacity to all good, and the most degrading subjection to the powers of darkness. This is the representation which the Volume of Truth makes of our condition as sinners, but not without informing us, that, since death produces no essential change in the mind, and is only a removal from a state of trial to one of retribution, the evils that belong to the sinner in this world will cling to him in the future state, and in their unrestrained and accelerated influence produce the eternal torment of hell.<br /><br />&quot;The glorious liberty of the children of God,&quot; -- that Liberty wherewith the Son makes free, is the release of the soul from this awful situation. The believer in Jesus Christ is delivered from the obligation to everlasting punishment when his guilt is removed by the forgiveness of sin, and a ground of hope furnished by the declaration of acquittal pronounced in the Word of God. But coincident with a man&#39;s being justified by faith is the regeneration of the moral nature by the gracious work of the Spirit of God, which is nothing less than a sinner&#39;s rescue from the yoke of sin and his being endued with the moral capacity and desire to love and serve God, so as no longer to be held in degrading thraldom by a misguided judgment, vicious affections, and depraved habits; but possessed of an enlargedness of soul towards God, resulting from an unbounded confidence in his love and implicit subjection to his will. The consequence attending such a state and character is, that the regenerated believer becomes heir to all the privileges of the gospel, and to all the perfection and blessedness of Heaven.<br /><br />The remorse of an accusing conscience, the self-inflicted lashes of a mind preying upon itself, the guilt and fear that cause the God of justice and holiness to be regarded as an inexorable tyrant, and the dreadful apprehensions with which the sinner looks forward to his judgment hereafter, constitute a <em>bondage</em>&nbsp;from which no power whatever can deliver us, but that which resides in Jesus Christ as the Saviour of sinners. His blood can alone cleanse from sin; His death can alone furnish a ground of hope to the guilty; His promises are alone adequate to meet the situation and satisfy the mind of the victim of despair ; and His grace alone can avert the doom that hangs impending over the condemned sinner: and therefore He alone can &quot;proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound.&quot; He can make us <span style=\"small-caps\">free indeed</span>, both from the sentence of death pronounced by the law of God and recognized by our own conscience, and from the direful forebodings of endless misery.<br /><br /><span class=\"note\" rev=\"scalar:has_note\" resource=\"2-corinthians-317\" data-show-title=\"yes\" data-show-description=\"yes\" data-show-content=\"yes\" data-type=\"undefined\">&quot;Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty&quot;</span> -- the soul walks at large in the boundless regions of truth and goodness, and the wider its range and the less restricted its exercise, the higher is the degree of blessedness experienced. For the liberty of the children of God does not consist in being free from the government and service of God, but just the reverse, -- in willingly choosing it; it is not freedom from righteousness, but its perfection is measured by the degree of conformity to the rule of righteousness; it is not an exemption from obedience, but a man is the more free by how much the more freely and readily his obedience is rendered. &quot;Liberior qu\u00f2 divinae gratiae subjectior.&quot;<br /><br />The <em>perfection</em> of Christian liberty is only to be realized in Heaven, where every clog and hindrance by which the soul is now restrained will be left behind, and the free-born spirit, emancipated from every chain, shall have unbounded scope for its mightiest powers, its most ardent affections. This is beautifully represented by Howe, in his &quot;Blessedness of the Righteous,&quot; where the following passage occurs. &quot;The bird escaped from his line and stone, that resisted its vain and too feeble strugglings before; how pleasantly doth it range! with what joy doth it clap its wings and take its flight! A faint emblem of the joy wherewith that pleasant cheerful note shall one day be sung and chaunted forth. &quot;Our soul is escaped, as a bird out of the snare of the fowler; the snare is broken, and we are escaped.&quot; There is now no place for such a complaint, &#39;I would, but I cannot.&#39; The blessed soul feels itself free from all confinement: nothing resists its will, as its will doth never resist the will of God. It knows no limits, no restraints; it is not tied up to this or that particular good; but expatiates freely in the immense, universal, all-comprehending goodness of God himself.&quot;<br /><br />J.

He was a plantation-slave, and had been promoted for his consistent conduct. A few years ago, one of the slave-members belonging to the Baptist Church at Montego Bay was banished from his home, and sent to the estate where David lived, to be cured of his praying. By the pious conversation of this exiled christian negro, David was brought under serious concern for his soul, which ended in his conversion to God. Acting up to the christian negro&#39;s motto, that &quot;what good for one negro, good for him brother too,&quot; David spoke to his fellow-slaves about Jesus, and his love in dying for poor sinners. God, who despiseth not the humblest instrument, blessed the efforts of this poor negro, and, in a short time, about thirty on the estate began to pray, and at length built a small hut, in which, after the labours of the day, they might assemble and worship God. Tidings of these things reached the ears of the white persons employed on the estate, and David was summoned before his attorney, and asked whether he was teaching the slaves to pray. On replying in the affirmative, the hut was demolished and burnt, and David was stretched upon the earth and flogged with the cart-whip till his flesh was covered with his blood. Next Lord&#39;s-day I missed my faithful deacon at the house of God. His afllicted wife came and told me the sad tale of his sufferings, and informed me, that his hands were bound and his feet made fast in the stocks. Often did I inquire after him, and for him, and the same answer was returned, &quot;Massa, him in the stocks;&quot; till one morning, as I sat in my piazza, he appeared before the window. There he stood -- I have his image now before me -- he was hand-cuffed, barefoot, unable to wear his clothes from his yet unhealed back; his wife had fastened some of her garments round his lacerated body. I called him in, and said,<br /><br />&quot;David, David, what have you done?&quot;<br /><br />With a look of resignation I shall never forget, he replied,<br /><br />&quot;Don&#39;t ask me, ask him that bring me, massa.&quot;&nbsp;<br /><br />Turning to the negro who had him in charge, I said,<br /><br />&quot;Well, what has this poor man done?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Him pray, massa,&quot; was the reply, &quot;and Buchra sending him to the workhouse for punishing.&quot;<br /><br />I gave him some refreshment, for in the state I have described he had walked thirteen miles under a burning sun, and followed him to that den of cruelty, properly designated a Jamaica inquisition. He was chained to a fellow-slave by the neck, and sent to work on the public roads. The next day I went to visit him again, when I was informed by the supervisor of the workhouse, that he had received orders to have him flogged again, as soon as his back was well enough to bear it. In these chains David remained for months; frequently I saw him, but never did I hear one murmur or one complaint, except when he heard that the partner of his joys and sorrows was ill on the estate, and he was forbidden to go and see her.<br /><br />At the end of three months he was liberated, and returning to the estate, was asked,&nbsp;<br /><br />&quot;Now, sir, will you pray again?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Massa,&quot; said the persecuted disciple, &quot;you know me is a good slave, but if trouble come for dis, me must pray, and me must teach me broder to pray too.&quot;<br /><br />Again he was immured in a dungeon, and his feet made fast in the stocks.<br /><br /><span style=\"small-caps\">William Knibb</span>.", "type" : "literal" }

To the Editor&#39;s friends the causes which prevented its immediate publication are known: to strangers the detail would be intrusive and uninteresting. The valuable papers then kindly furnished, are now presented to the public, with many additional articles composed at later periods. They are, for the most part, arranged in the order in which they have been received. The pieces commemorative of the Abolition of the System will therefore be found towards the close of the volume: those referring to the former State of the Slave occupy the earlier pages.</p><p>To those readers who, at first sight, may think that the papers written before the abolition of the system are now out of date and should have been suppressed, the Compiler ventures to suggest, that, even if the appointed apprenticeship of four and six years were already expired, yet the past sorrows of the Negro, and the long-continued apathy of the nation in disregarding his bitter griefs, should be ever remembered with deep humility before God.&quot; We have been verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear.&quot;</p><p>And, though Slavery is banished by legislative enactment from the British colonies, over many parts of the globe it still exerts its cruel influence. &quot;Slavery, wherever it exists, is the same moral deformity,-- the same crime before God, and ought to be viewed with detestation, and reprobated with boldness, by every man who professes to act on christian principles . . . . Not less than FIVE MILLIONS of our fellow creatures are still detained in hopeless bond age by the avarice and cruelty of man. . . . There is too much reason to believe, that the extensive trade still carried on in the French, Spanish, and Portuguese colonies, is sustained by British capital, and screened by British ingenuity. In Cuba and the Brazils, and in some of the French colonies, the market for human cattle is daily supplied from the coast of Africa; while the mines of Chili and Peru are peopled with miserable, though guiltless, victims, whose blood is drained by a system of unparalleled horror, to fill the pockets of English shareholders!&quot;<span class=\"note\" rev=\"scalar:has_note\" resource=\"authorial-note-1-mary-anne-rawson\" data-show-title=\"yes\" data-show-description=\"yes\" data-show-content=\"yes\">1</span>&nbsp;Upwards of two millions of unhappy negroes are doomed to suffer the brand and curse of slavery, in its most degraded form, in the United States of America, -- that land of boasted freedom, while the condition of the free people of colour, whose number exceeds 300,000, is only in a slight degree advanced.<span class=\"note\" rev=\"scalar:has_note\" resource=\"authorial-note-2-mary-anne-rawson\" data-show-title=\"yes\" data-show-description=\"yes\" data-show-content=\"yes\">2</span>&nbsp;And though the notice may appear somewhat incongruous in a work especially relating to Negro Slavery, the Editor cannot forbear to allude to the noble-minded Poles, dying beneath the weight of another species of thraldom, if possible, still more galling. For these, prayer should not be omitted, nor should effort be restrained.</p><p>And even as regards the British colonies the work of mercy is yet imperfect. The personal emancipation of the Negro cannot be regarded as the full amount of his powerful and peculiar claims. A debt is still owing him, which can only be discharged by combined and persevering effort, prompted by the benevolence, and regulated by the wisdom, which are from above; and happily, by these means the debt can be discharged, and that abundantly. Having in times past been rendered vile, he must now be elevated in the scale of being, by means of moral and religious instruction. Let the &quot;glad tidings of great joy, which are unto all people,&quot; be sounded in the ears of these despised ones, and let them be made acquainted with that freedom wherewith Christ can make them free. Blessed be God! multitudes of these wretched outcasts have already heard the joyful sound, and the hope of Heaven has shed light and peace along their dreary path;<span class=\"note\" rev=\"scalar:has_note\" resource=\"authorial-note-3-mary-anne-rawson\" data-show-title=\"yes\" data-show-description=\"no\" data-show-content=\"yes\">3</span>&nbsp;May the recital of the wrongs and sufferings of the Slave, contained in this volume, excite to greatly increased exertions in this blessed work, and thus may the Lord turn the curse into a blessing!</p><p>To those talented and esteemed individuals to whose friendly aid this little work is indebted for its existence, the most sincere thanks are offered, though with a conscious ness that such expressions of gratitude can be of little value. Although they wrote, doubtless, from the deep interest which the subject inspired, yet the Editor feels a personal obligation to have been conferred by the very obliging manner in which their contributions have been presented.</p><p>It would indeed have been delightful if every hand which has been actively engaged in pulling down the prison-house, and striking off the fetters of the bondman, could have put a stone into the monument here erected upon its ruins, to tell posterity where it stood, the curses it contained, and how it fell. To many, who have laboured long, and nobly, and successfully in this cause, the Editor had no means of access; to others, acknowledgments are due for the kind interest they have expressed in the plan and success of a work which various circumstances have prevented them from aiding. It is a subject for thankfulness that so many have assisted in raising this memorial, which, though small in its dimensions and humble in its design, the Compiler believes will be found a structure of moral and literary architecture, in some degree worthy of the great occasion.</p><p>Nothing is inserted in these pages which was not presented to the Editor expressly for the purpose; though, on account of the delay that has occurred, it is feared that a few of the papers may have appeared in print in other forms.</p><p>There may possibly, on some points, be slight differences of opinion between the various writers in this little volume; it is, therefore, desirable to remark, that the authors are responsible only for the pieces to which their names are appended.</p><p>Some of the allusions to the West Indian planters may be considered unwarrantably harsh. It must not for a moment be supposed that reference is made to those amiable and respectable persons in this country who have had the misfortune to inherit colonial property. The majority of the resident planters--the attorneys--the managers are here intended. If the records of the &quot;Colonial Church Union,&quot; and many of the Speeches in the Jamaica House of Assembly are consulted, it can scarcely be said that any language is too severe.</p><p>Should this little volume in any degree contribute to sustain and prolong the sympathy of late so widely excited in behalf of the deeply-injured negroes, the authors of the following pieces, and the individual who has now the pleasure of presenting them to the public, will indeed have reason to rejoice together, and every benevolent reader may share in that joy.</p><p><span style=\"small-caps\">Wincobank Hall,</span><br /><em>May 8, 1834</em>.</p></div>", "type" : "literal" }

      { "value" : "&quot;Persecuted, but not forsaken.&quot;<br /><br /><span style=\"small-caps\">I had</span> laboured on the slave-cursed, though otherwise lovely island of Jamaica, in the humble character of a missionary, for the space of seven years, when some faint intimations reached me and my brethren that the unhappy victims of despotic power, the deeply-injured slaves, goaded by the cruelties and taunts of their guilty oppressors, had resolved on freeing themselves from the iron yoke of bondage under which they were held; but we had not the smallest idea of the extent to which the spirit of insubordination had been awakened. After having successfully allayed the excitement amongst the Christian slaves by whom we were surrounded, we assembled with our beloved flock in the house of prayer, that we might enjoy that comfort which communion with God in His ordinances imparts. All was hurry, confusion, and sin without, -- within the sanctuary was that peace which Jesus alone bestows. In the evening of this ever-memorable Sabbath, the small band of missionaries solemnly commended each other to God; Jesus was in our midst, and the protracted evening devotions were a preparative for the trials which awaited us. On the following Tuesday I was arrested, with two of my brother-missionaries. In vain did we demand the reason of this proceeding: <em>martial law</em> bad been proclaimed, which was the signal that every enormity might be practised with impunity. While walking to and fro in the barracks, one of the officers came, and said, &quot;I am commanded by the colonel of the militia to inform you that you are to proceed to head-quarters in half an hour.&quot; The request to be permitted to take leave of our wives and children having been denied by these christian slave-drivers, and our pockets having been searched, marched between four soldiers with their muskets loaded, we commenced our melancholy journey. On our arrival at the sea-beach, a small boat was procured, in which we were placed with our infuriated guards. Exposed to a tropical sun, and our feet saturated with water from the leakage of the boat, we were rowed a distance of twenty-two miles. Arriving at Montego Bay, we were marched and counter-marched from one place to another, exposed to the insults of those who thirsted for our blood. At length we were placed in the jury-box in the Courthouse, which had been converted into a prison, where the most horrid scene presented itself. The curses of the slave-drivers were of the most revolting description, and, together with the inhuman cruelties practised upon the slaves whom they had captured, produced an impression upon my mind which will never be effaced. Being overcome by fatigue, I requested permission to lie down on the boards, when the sentinel replied, &quot;No, you villain; if you stir one step I&#39;ll stab you to the heart: you are to be shot in the morning, and I shall be very glad to have a shot at you.&quot; God, however, in His mercy interposed, and in this time of need raised up a friend, who, with much difficulty and personal hazard, effected our deliverance; and thus we were rescued from the hands of those who intended our death, and who gloried in the prospect of imbruing their hands in our blood. &quot;Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel.&quot;<br /><br />During the following six weeks we were held on bail, and frequently exposed to imminent peril, while every effort was made by the colonists to effect our destruction. Every means they used to implicate us in the rebellion completely failed; and God, in His mercy, saved His servants &quot;because they trusted in Him.&quot; When we were released from restraint, I returned to the people of my charge; their joy was unbounded, and their expressions of affection quite overwhelming; some clasped my knees, some my hands, and others my feet; while, with eyes suffused with tears, they thanked that God who had again restored to them the minister they loved.<br /><br />William Knibb.<br /><br />----<br /><br />[A Letter which the Editor has lately received from another devoted Missionary, contains the following striking and affecting account of the feelings of the Christian Slaves towards their cruel persecutors.]<br /><br />&quot;<span style=\"small-caps\">You</span> are aware of my arrest and imprisonment, as well as that of other Missionaries, during the sanguinary persecutions of 1831 and 1832. The cruel sufferings inflicted upon many of the christian negroes during that period, for their attachment to the Redeemer and His cause, can never be fully related; so that had they given vent to their feelings, by the most indignant expressions, it could not have excited our surprise: but so far from this, I do not remember to have heard one christian slave, during the whole of those terrible persecutions, indulge in a vindictive term towards any of his malignant oppressors. When I arrived at my lodgings, on the day of my liberation from incarceration, crowds of my afflicted friends thronged to see me, giving vent to their feelings by their many tears and their kindly expressions of sympathy on account of my sufferings, and congratulations for my triumph over my bitter foes, who were thirsting for my blood. Amongst many other interesting remarks, one poor christian negro addressed me in the following manner: &#39;Massa,&#39; said he, &#39;no you feel too bad. We enemy, -- dem wicked, -- dem bad for true, Massa; -- dem take we neger, -- dem shoot we, -- dem hang we, -- dem flog we, -- dem &#39;pill we blood, as though we no worth at all -- but, minister, we must pray for dem -- dem very bad, -- dem very wicked, -- but, <span style=\"small-caps\">Dem no convert yet</span>!!!&#39; A noble apology made by one of those despised slaves in behalf of those cruel men, and which cannot but remind us of the spirit and prayer of the blessed Redeemer upon the cross, &#39;Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.&#39; &#39;<span style=\"small-caps\">Dem no convert yet</span>!!!&#39;&quot;", "type" : "literal" }

She had long been a consistent Christian, and to her affliction&#39;s full cup of sorrows had been meted out. When I was requested to visit her, she was in the last stage of a consumption. On entering her lowly hut, I found her lying on a mat, her head supported by a box, which I suppose contained her little all. Never &quot;while memory holds her seat,&quot; shall I forget the interview. She looked at me with much affection, and said,<br /><br />&quot;Minister, me is glad to see you. Me did not like to die, minister, till me see you.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Why so, my friend?&quot; I replied.<br /><br />&quot;Minister, me wish to tell you how good God is; Him is too good--Him is too good, minister.&quot;<br /><br />After speaking with her for some time, I said,<br /><br />&quot;Well, you are about to die, my sister; are you afraid to die?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;No, minister, me is not afraid to die.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Do you not know that you have been a great sinner?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Yes, me <em>feel</em>&nbsp;that; but, minister, Jesus, Him die for sinner, and me is not afraid to die. Me shall soon be with Jesus, and me shall sing with Jesus for ever and ever.&quot;<br /><br />At her request I read a portion of the word of God, and, kneeling by her side, prayed with her. On leaving, I took her by the hand and said, &quot;I wish you, my sister, an abundant entrance into the kingdom of God.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Thank you, minister,&quot; the dying saint replied. &quot;Me shall soon be there, and please, when you go home, tell the other minister, that me hope God will give him two crowns, when him come to Heaven, because him leave him country, and teach me, a poor slave, the way to go there.&quot;<br /><br />In a few hours, calm and resigned, she breathed her last; and her happy spirit, wafted by angels into the presence of her Saviour, took possession of the promised rest. Thus ended the mortal career of one, on whom the curse of slavery rested heavily for years. Sweet indeed must heaven be to the toil-worn negro. She hears not the voice of the oppressor, while the Lamb that is in the midst of the throne leads her, and feeds her; and God, having wiped the last tear from her eyes, the days of her mourning are ended. The next day her remains were committed to the lowly tomb.<br /><br /><br />&quot;Nor pain, nor grief, nor anxious fear,&nbsp;<br />Invade thy bounds--no mortal woes<br />Can reach the lonely sleeper here,&nbsp;<br />And angels watch her soft repose.&quot;<br /><br /><span style=\"small-caps\">William Knibb</span>", "type" : "literal" }

      { "value" : "<h2>Brief History of the Anthology [in progress]</h2>By <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://research.sas.ac.uk/search/staff/1216/dr-christopher-ohge/\">Christopher Ohge</a> (School of Advanced Study, University of London)<br />[last revised 18 August 2023]<p>The <em>Bow in the Cloud</em>&nbsp;is an anti-slavery anthology that was published in 1834&nbsp;by the London firm of Walford &amp; Jackson, in St. Paul&rsquo;s Churchyard. The anthology consists of 85 poems and prose pieces by a mixture of well-known and non-professional writers involved in anti-slavery societies throughout Great Britain. It was edited by Mary Anne Rawson, n\u00e9e Read (1801&ndash;1887), who sought to create what she called in her Preface to the anthology &lsquo;a structure of moral and literary architecture&rsquo;.&nbsp;In 1826, Mary Anne Read, a young activist and secretary of the&nbsp;Sheffield Ladies Anti-slavery Society, encouraged by the example of her philanthropist parents,&nbsp;started compiling the anthology to influence public opinion.&nbsp;By 1834, Mary Anne, now married to George Rawson, and still living in Sheffield, had&nbsp;shepherded&nbsp;<em>The Bow in the Cloud</em>&nbsp;into publication with a major London publisher to commemorate the 1833&nbsp;Slavery Abolition Act (which came into effect on 1 August 1834).<br /><br /><em>The Bow in the Cloud</em>&nbsp;came with international aspirations&nbsp;to bolster various abolitionist movements throughout the world while also offering a record of voices in the British anti-slavery movement. The making of the book encompassed the time when slavery had been abolished in the UK (and was still legal in the colonies), to when it was abolished in most of the colonies but still very much alive in British territories owned by&nbsp;the East India Company and in many other parts of the world such as the United States and Brazil.</p><p>The book had a print run of 500 copies and was sold for 12 shillings, which is about &pound;50 in today&rsquo;s money. Put another way, it was about two days pay for a skilled tradesman, or about the cost of a week&rsquo;s supply of butchered meat and tea. In other words, this was a middle-class product, on the edge of affordability.</p><a data-size=\"medium\" data-align=\"left\" data-caption=\"description\" data-annotations=\"\" resource=\"media/bow-in-the-cloud-book-cover\" name=\"scalar-inline-media\" href=\"https://christopherohge.com/education/bow-in-the-cloud/media/book_cover.jpeg\"></a><p>Like other gift books of the time, the volume appears handsome: its foolscap octavo pages (at 6&frac34;&quot;&nbsp;x 4&frac14;&quot;) were gilt on the edges and bound in turkey morocco with a gilded engraving on the cover. The publication&rsquo;s advertisement pamphlet called attention to its quality, which is partly true: while the (blended) goatskin-based binding is somewhat&nbsp;sturdy, it&nbsp;was bound a bit too tightly&nbsp;and has clearly frayed at the edges (a higher quality binding would not fray in that way). The gilded pages were also an affectation of the publishing world that did not add significantly to the quality. The foolscap pages themselves were also small and fairly reflective of most publications of the time, so it was not an exceptional piece of craft. Instead it was a production that combined aspects of the new forms of the literary anthology and the &#39;gift-book&#39; economy.</p><a data-size=\"medium\" data-align=\"left\" data-caption=\"description\" data-annotations=\"\" resource=\"media/bow-in-the-cloud-advertisement\" name=\"scalar-inline-media\" href=\"https://christopherohge.com/education/bow-in-the-cloud/media/MS-ENGLISH-00414-00001-B-000-00001.jpeg\"></a><p>The book is sizeable: it comes to just over 400&nbsp;pages.&nbsp;The book&rsquo;s frontispiece was signed by H. Corbould (Edward Henry Corbould). Here is his original version of the etching that was printed before the book&rsquo;s title page.<a data-size=\"medium\" data-align=\"left\" data-caption=\"description\" data-annotations=\"\" resource=\"media/title-page-illustration\" name=\"scalar-inline-media\" href=\"https://christopherohge.com/education/bow-in-the-cloud/media/title-pg-illustration.jpeg\"></a>&nbsp;In 1833 the nineteen-year-old Corbould was at the beginning of a distinguished career as a book illustrator and watercolour artist. In the same year that&nbsp;<em>The Bow in the Cloud</em>&nbsp;was published, he received his first of several gold medals from the Society of Arts, and he later refined his literary appreciation by creating illustrated editions of Chaucer, Spenser, Shakespeare, and Tennyson. One of Corbould&rsquo;s letters sent to the publishers Jackson and Walford even includes his fee for the illustration: 4 pounds 40. Details like these abound in Rawson&#39;s rich archive.</p><h2>Significance of the Anthology</h2><p>What requires further study is the nature of the enterprise itself: this is an anthology, edited by a pioneering woman with specific aims that were complicated to articulate, at a crucial time in history. Attending to what book historian Tom Mole calls the dynamic cultural practices of &lsquo;selecting, abridging, excerpting, framing, and mediating&rsquo; of texts shows &lsquo;the power of anthologies to shape how their readers read&rsquo; (<span class=\"note\" rev=\"scalar:has_note\" resource=\"what-the-victorians-made-of-romanticism\" data-show-title=\"yes\" data-show-description=\"yes\" data-show-content=\"yes\">Mole 2017</span>, p. 188). Also, as&nbsp;Dr <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.ncl.ac.uk/elll/people/profile/fionnghualasweeney.html\">Fionnghuala Sweeney</a> has shown in her work on abolitionist publishing histories, much can be learned by studying in detail the racial, gender, and religious&nbsp;intersections of&nbsp;anti-slavery social networks.<br /><br />The <em>Bow in the Cloud</em> demonstrates unique practices for several reasons: it is an early example of the political literary anthology, and a rather large one (over&nbsp;400 pages) with some long pieces, and it features grassroots activists, politicians, and well-known literary writers (but no famous Romantic authors, although Rawson tried to commission work from the likes of Wordsworth, Southey, and Thomas Moore). This kind of eclectic book not only reflected growing literacy rates in the UK but also was the product of several decades of energy from various publishing movements, including the religious press, cheaper printing technologies, the expansion of the literary marketplace after the era of radical political publishing, and the gift books published by&nbsp;women&#39;s anti-slavery societies.</p><p><br />The <em>Bow in the Cloud</em> also comes with an under-researched manuscript collection of more than 600 items that is vast and revealing &ndash; particularly so for an anthology of this kind, with so many contributors.&nbsp;It is unusual for a collection like this -- that is, a nineteenth-century anthology -- to have such a rich archive of surviving manuscripts. The reason for this is that Rawson saved almost everything she received during the project. She later collected the manuscripts into a two-volume scrapbook with quality bindings. Below are the notes that accompanied each volume.<br />&nbsp;<br /><a data-size=\"medium\" data-align=\"right\" data-caption=\"description\" data-annotations=\"\" class=\"inline wrap\" resource=\"note-on-the-contents-of-the-manuscript-scrapbooks-for-the-bow-in-the-cloud-english-ms-4141a\" name=\"scalar-inline-media\" href=\"https://www.digitalcollections.manchester.ac.uk/iiif/MS-ENGLISH-00414-00001-A?iiif-manifest=1\"></a><br />Mrs. Rawson<br />Winco Bank Hall<br />Rotherham<br />1a<br /><br />This [first]&nbsp;Volume contains the<br />original manuscripts of the<br />&quot;Bow in the Cloud&quot; with portraits of the <strike>Writers</strike> Authors<br />M.

A. R.<br /><br /><br />Most submissions to the anthology came with a covering letter (and some submissions have multiple letters spanning from 1826 to 1834).&nbsp;Some pieces also have&nbsp;photographs, artworks, engravings, or newspaper clippings in the scrapbook. This illustration below is a good example of the wealth of archival material in this collection: it is a watercolour illustration submitted by Ann&nbsp;Gilbert to accompany her poem &#39;The Mother&#39; (the poem was published in the anthology but not this&nbsp;accompanying illustration).<br /><br /><a class=\"inline wrap\" data-size=\"large\" data-align=\"left\" data-caption=\"title-and-description\" data-annotations=\"\" resource=\"three-slaves-on-the-shore-1\" name=\"scalar-inline-media\" href=\"https://www.digitalcollections.manchester.ac.uk/iiif/MS-ENGLISH-00415-00152-A?iiif-manifest=1\"></a><br /><br />Some of those fair copies show evidence of her revisions to the pieces before she supplied a printer&rsquo;s copy to the publisher. Rawson also collected&nbsp;poems that she chose not to publish.<br /><br />The entire manuscript collection, housed at the John Rylands Library (Eng MSS 414 and 415), was digitised in 2020, as part of a digital humanities start-up grant from the John Rylands Research Institute, University of Manchester, in 2018/2019. The digital images of more than 600 surviving manuscripts total 818 high-resolution files which are now available on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.digitalcollections.manchester.ac.uk/collections/bowinthecloud/3\">Manchester Digital Collections</a>&ndash;&ndash;with extensive metadata of each item based on a thorough&nbsp;study of the manuscripts&ndash;&ndash;as open-access images on a IIIF image viewer (Mirador). Editor Christopher Ohge has written about this project in a 2019&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://sites.manchester.ac.uk/jrri-blog/2019/04/24/the-making-of-an-anti-slavery-anthology-mary-anne-rawson-and-the-bow-in-the-cloud-part-1/\">blog post</a> and then featured it as a section (&#39;Exhibition&#39;) in&nbsp;<em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/elements/abs/publishing-scholarly-editions/D5A9FCEA4DECF1DE798B938BA48B2ED3\">Publishing Scholarly Editions: Archives, Computing, and Experience</a></em>&nbsp;(Cambridge University Press, 2021). A separate <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/cmohge1/bow-in-the-cloud-edition\">GitHub repository</a> collects all of the project data, including TEI XML transcriptions of the published pieces and manuscripts.<br /><br />Attending to these neglected documents makes it possible to discern Rawson&rsquo;s rationale for connecting with her target audiences, and to see how her choice of material mediated anti-slavery rhetoric at a crucial time when the British were passing the 1833 Slavery Abolition Act and the American abolitionist movement, led by William Lloyd Garrison, was publishing their highest volume of print material.<br /><br />The focus on Rawson&rsquo;s editorial rationale presents a challenge to textual scholars: it combines aspects of several editorial approaches, including the documentary, genetic text, and social text theories, yet it also adopts a principle of Rawson&rsquo;s editorial intentions using a logic similar to a critical editor&rsquo;s. Instead of focusing on the authorial intentions of the writers in the anthology, we&nbsp;follow Rawson&rsquo;s editorial judgements as the anchor for textual decision-making. The fact that the book is a multi-author literary anthology also presents new challenges to an editor.<br /><br />Another editorial challenge involves the status of the scrapbook itself.&nbsp;As Eleanor Bird suggests, &#39;The scrapbooks are a collection in their own right and can be understood not only as Rawson&rsquo;s attempt to store her papers relating to the gift book, but to preserve a record of her relationships and a memory of her writing project&#39; (<span class=\"note\" rev=\"scalar:has_note\" resource=\"bird-2021\" data-show-title=\"yes\" data-show-description=\"yes\" data-show-content=\"yes\" data-type=\"undefined\">Bird 2021</span>, paragraph 23). Yet it is an open question as to whether an intimate circle of Rawson&rsquo;s family and friends circulated Rawson&#39;s&nbsp;<em>Bow in the Cloud</em>&nbsp;scrapbooks instead of the printed gift book, and whether some of those manuscript copies were made before or after the anthology was printed. Several of Rawson&#39;s fair copies of manuscripts clearly precede the printed book. This can be demonstrated by the fact that many of Rawson&#39;s fair copies differ from the final published version, suggesting that further revisions were made in a printer&#39;s copy. But there are other pieces of evidence that many of these copies preceded the publication and were used as preparatory copies for a printer&#39;s copy. For example, on the top of the first page of&nbsp;Burchell&#39;s narrative (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.digitalcollections.manchester.ac.uk/view/MS-ENGLISH-00414-00060-B/1\">English MS 414/60b</a>), Rawson wrote in pencil &#39;To follow Knibb&#39;s Persecuted Missionary...&#39; These pieces of evidence show that many (if not all) of these manuscripts were first part of the editorial enterprise before they were scrapbooked.</p><p><br />Bird rightly concludes that &#39;By presenting these voices wholesale, Rawson connected to a moment of national reflection on the legacy of British colonial slavery in 1833-34 and placed her own abolitionist ideas and activism within this wider context. The scrapbooks therefore not only preserve the contributions and letters but collate a vaster archive that represented a wider social network than was involved in the printed version&#39; (<span class=\"note\" rev=\"scalar:has_note\" resource=\"bird-2021\" data-show-title=\"yes\" data-show-description=\"yes\" data-show-content=\"yes\" data-type=\"undefined\">Bird 2021</span>, paragraph 25). It is the goal of this edition to evince this &#39;vaster archive&#39; with digital tools.<br /><br />At the same time, the documentary and book historical focus of this project requires further attention to how the book was made.&nbsp;<em>The Bow in the Cloud</em>, as published, was representative of the abolitionist movement at this time, featuring religious leaders, politicians, non-professional writers, and writers of repute. Among those who declined, however, are prominent names such as William Wordsworth, Robert Southey, Thomas Moore, Thomas Babington Macaulay, and one of the founders of the British abolitionist movement, Thomas Clarkson.<br /><br />The publisher, Jackson &amp; Walford,&nbsp;was probably best known as the publisher of the nonconformist, progressive magazine&nbsp;<em>Eclectic Review</em>&nbsp;as well as the <em>Congregational Year Books</em>&nbsp;and other ecclesiastical books. One of the contributors to <em>The Bow in the Cloud</em>, Josiah Conder, had since 1813 been the owner and editor of the <em>Eclectic Review</em>, which also featured a substantial and laudatory review of <em>The Bow in the Cloud</em> in its July 1834 issue. This review was significant, since the <em>Eclectic Review</em> was one of the&nbsp;most prestigious literary periodicals of its time, one that published not only prominent romantic authors but also American authors such as Washington Irving. It was not long after the publication of <em>The Bow in the Cloud</em> that American abolitionists William Lloyd Garrison and Frederick Douglass visited Rawson and several of her peers, illustrating the significance of this figure and her noble attempt to influence public opinion through the force of literature and transatlantic networks.<br /><br />Rawson&rsquo;s publication intersects with&nbsp;the moment in 1834 when, as Richard Huzzey has argued in his book <span class=\"note\" rev=\"scalar:has_note\" resource=\"huzzey-2012\" data-show-title=\"yes\" data-show-description=\"yes\" data-show-content=\"yes\">Freedom Burning:&nbsp;Anti-Slavery and Empire in Victorian Britain (2012)</span>, the British started to use &lsquo;anti-slavery&rsquo; as a national credo that projected moral superiority over other civilisations.&nbsp;Yet Rawson&rsquo;s anthology, and particularly the cache of unpublished material she decided to save, shows that she was aware that such posturing was far from altruistic or compassionate, as new forms of violence and economic exploitation of colonial possessions continued to be central to British foreign policy and British allies.<br /><br />Rawson&rsquo;s editing of the anthology show her as an active editor, organiser, and writer. Rawson relied on her social network of anti-slavery activists, through the Sheffield Ladies Anti-Slavery Society but also in London and elsewhere. The details are also data and statistics that could aid researchers, and that is the guiding principle of producing this digital edition.</p><h2>Editorial Principles</h2>The primary purpose of this edition is to show how the anthology was constructed based on the surviving documentary evidence. There are three parts to the edition: the published version of&nbsp;<em>The Bow in the Cloud</em>&nbsp;(along with the attendant manuscripts from the scrapbook relating to each piece); a selection of important unpublished material, including poems that were submitted but not published in 1834, letters from authors who declined to contribute to the anthology, and letters from contributors who offered thoughts on the anthology; and network analysis and mapping tools to demonstrate the social and semantic networks, as well as the geographical clusters, of the people associated with the anthology.<p>The edition adopts a pluralistic approach that is indebted to Peter Shillingsburg&#39;s and John Bryant&#39;s theories--<span class=\"note\" rev=\"scalar:has_note\" resource=\"shillingsburg-2006\" data-show-title=\"yes\" data-show-description=\"yes\" data-show-content=\"yes\" data-type=\"undefined\">Shillingsburg&#39;s digital pluralism</span>, and <span class=\"note\" rev=\"scalar:has_note\" resource=\"bryant-2002\" data-show-title=\"yes\" data-show-description=\"yes\" data-show-content=\"yes\" data-type=\"undefined\">Bryant&#39;s &#39;fluid text&#39; theory</span> in particular.&nbsp;This edition&#39;s&nbsp;focus on Rawson&rsquo;s editorial rationale therefore employs aspects of several editorial approaches, including the historical-documentary, genetic text, and social text theories, yet it also adopts a principle of Rawson&rsquo;s editorial intentions using a logic similar to a critical editor&rsquo;s. Instead of focusing on the authorial intentions of the writers in the anthology, I follow Rawson&rsquo;s editorial judgements as the anchor for textual decision-making. The fact that the book is a multi-author literary anthology also presents new challenges to an editor. At the same time, the documentary and book historical focus requires attention to how the book was made and disseminated.</p>To examine the published pieces in the anthology, readers can enter an annotated clear reading text of each piece, in the order in which they appeared in the published anthology. At the end of each reading text, textual &#39;paths&#39; take the reader through the surviving versions from the manuscript archive. Typically these versions include a fair copy of the piece, edited by Rawson, the original submission by the author, and one or more cover letters sent to Rawson.&nbsp;<br /><br />Readers can also select the Table of Contents (triple-bar) button in the top-left of the interface to explore other pieces in the edition. For example, users can access prototype network visualisation tools by clicking on the <a href=\"https://christopherohge.com/education/bow-in-the-cloud/network-graph\">Network Analysis</a> item in the Table of Contents. For example, the &#39;connections&#39; interface shows the relationships between page entities and semantic tags relating to those pages and their associated media files.<br /><br /><a data-viscontent=\"all\" data-visformat=\"force-directed\" data-align=\"center\" data-widget=\"visualization\" data-visrelations=\"all\" data-size=\"full\" data-caption=\"none\" name=\"scalar-inline-widget\"></a><br />Another interface, <a href=\"https://christopherohge.com/education/bow-in-the-cloud/map-of-places-mentioned\">Map of Places Mentioned</a>, displays an annotated map of places associated with the manuscript archive and published anthology. The purpose of this tool is to demonstrate the geographical links in this anti-slavery print network.<br /><br />Such tools are meant to emphasise different reading experiences of this edition, and to facilitate new research questions and methods of discovery.&nbsp;<br /><br />Please be aware that this edition is an organic project. It is being added to every day.

      { "value" : "(Extract from a Letter.)<br /><br /><span style=\"small-caps\">An</span> incident at this moment recurs to my mind, of which I was not myself an eye-witness, although it took place in an engagement wherein, I regret to say, I bore a part; I can nevertheless vouch for its authenticity, as it was related to me by a very dear friend, who (as an officer of the Black Regiment to which the individual to whom the fact relates belonged) fought in the same action.<br /><br />At the capture of Martinique in the year 1808, I (as an officer of the corps of Royal Engineers, in which I attained the rank of captain) was engaged in throwing up batteries for the purpose of assaulting Fort Dessaix; the enemy discovering our intention, sent out a strong party to dislodge us, which of course we were obliged to repel.<br /><br />Our troops moved forward, and finding a wood on their left flank, the Black Regiment was thrown into it, in order to prevent any ambuscade from frustrating our design, and we soon found this precaution to have been necessary by the detached firing which took place. As the party pushed forward, a black soldier, who happened to be in the rear, was separated from his company; while so situated, he perceived a French officer similarly circumstanced. The soldier levelled his firelock, and called on the officer to surrender. The latter, finding he had no hope of escape, threw down his sword and knelt on one knee close by it, thus appearing to surrender, when, in fact, he only intended to deceive his adversary by this *ruse de guerre*, in order to get the advantage, by drawing him within reach of his point, for he could not have advanced openly to combat with a sword against a musket. The black soldier recovered his arms, and credulously proceeded to take his prisoner without being *en garde*: the officer watched for the moment when the soldier approached to the desired distance, then seizing his sword, sprang on his legs, and directed a desperate thrust at the breast of his benefactor, who, unprepared for such an act of treachery, had no other alternative than to raise his arm for the purpose of defending himself: by this means he exposed the very part at which the French officer directed his point. It fortunately failed of accomplishing the purpose of its director, nnd struck the breast-plate-a piece of brass which is attached to the centre of the cross-belt; and such was the force of the thrust, that the weapon shivered to pieces. Thus the black soldier once more obtained the advantage; his muscular arm being already raised in the air, with a heavy fire-lock in his hand, be might, at one blow, have (in all human probability) dashed his opponent into eternity: but no -- a second time he spared him! To prove, however, his loyalty to those he served, he seized him by the collar, brought him to his officer, and related the circumstance in a plain unvarnished manner. The English officer asked the prisoner, whether or not the statement was correct. He assented to its correctness, alleging by way of excuse, that he could not be expected to surrender to a Negro! The English officer rebuked him, and sent him to the rear.<br /><br />Such magnanimous conduct as that of this noble black would be lauded in *any* soldier; but as the black regiments in those days were supplied by negroes purchased from the holds of slave-ships, it appears that this soldier must have been one of those, who, at the war-whoop&#39;s infernal yell, had but recently been surprised and torn from their happy homes by armed bands of hired emissaries: -- one who had undergone all the vicissitudes of fortune experienced by the shackled prisoner -- the freighted package -- the transported wretch -- the miserable slave: -- but who now, as a soldier, having the opportunity of satisfying his revenge by shooting one of those white men who so cruelly afflicted him, nobly refrained, -- returned good for evil, -- and proved triumphantly that the black man is capable of attaining to the very highest point of charity.<br /><br /><span style=\"small-caps\">George Pilkington</span>.", "type" : "literal" }

Whilst travelling towards the place of my summer destination, I was induced to spend a few days at the location of a respectable farmer. Agreeably to the first night&#39;s arrangement, we arose by times on the following morning, for we had a journey of some extent to perform. A public *vendue* (or auction) was to take place at a distance of about forty miles, and my host and his family, including myself, were to be present. We entered our travelling waggon, drawn by eight beautiful horses, just as the glories of an African sun were bursting upon our world. For many miles we travelled over those pleasant natural roads which are so peculiar to many sections of this wonderful country. But things varied as we reached our first *uitspan* (or resting-place). After enjoying a hearty meal in a solitary glen, and by the side of a quiet water, our journey was renewed; but we had many a height to climb and many a fearful descent to undertake. The whole country was untenanted, and the still&shy;ness of the air was unbroken by the note of a bird, or by any sounds of rural nature. Yet, for all this, there appeared in various directions evident exhibitions of natural fitness for human population. But this is no discovery. You are better acquainted with the country than I am.</p><p>On our arrival at the place of sale, we found a large concourse of people assembled, with bargain-hunting countenances of varied hues. Around the house furniture of every description was arranged. Very near a lot of ploughs, harrows, and a desultory mass of invalided utensils, stood a group of human beings, awaiting their destiny. Sorrow was depicted in each countenance: all was dumb silence. One interesting creature stood apart from her fellow-sufferers, and was sharing the more visible grief of a well-dressed young woman with an infant child in her arms. Anxious to know more of the particulars of sale, I was informed that the farmer had been ruined by becoming security for an unworthy neighbour,--that his property had been taken in execution,--that the young white woman was the married daughter of the farmer, and had travelled from the district of Graaf-Reinet, to be present at the melancholy breaking-up of her father&#39;s house;--and that the slave, who was her partner in grief, had been her companion from childhood, and between them there had always existed much mutual affection. To purchase her favourite girl she was unable; her means were slender;--besides there was a determination on the part of a dealer from S---- to purchase the maid at a very high price;--her merits were known,--and he could procure ten per cent. for his money by *letting out* the purchase to the lady of the ---- of S----. A knowledge of these circumstances added greatly to the affliction of the poor slave.</p><p>About the middle of the day the sale of the slaves commenced. The first was a youth of twenty. His cries were piercing. Amidst the vulgar jokes and brutal sayings of the multitude, he was knocked down to a boor, who immediately carried off his bargain. The next was the female in question. There was an intense anxiety mani&shy;fested as she was led to be exhibited on the table. She sobbed aloud, as did her young mistress in the back-ground. The bidding commenced at twelve hundred rix-dollars, (90l.) and at every succeeding advance her moans were most piteous. When the price advanced to eighteen hundred rix-dollars, she became almost frantic, especially as there was a pause, and the auctioneer uplifted his hammer. The biddings however re-com&shy;menced with renewed vigour. The slave-dealer from S---- was the highest bidder, when the poor girl, Maria, cried out,-- &quot;Jesus, save me! Lord, help me!&quot;</p><p>Just at this moment the dogs of the farm set up a loud barking, which arrested general attention. From the mountain&#39;s side, at the foot of which stands the farm-house, three horse&shy;men were seen winding their way down its pathless declivity. This unusual route, and the fearfulness of the descent, attracted the curiosity of the crowd below, and suspended the business of the day. The appearance too of one of the party was an object of some novelty. The stranger who was approaching, attended by two Hottentots, was muffled up in a roquelaure of Scottish tartan. The other parts of his dress discovered a similar disregard to the intensity of the summer&#39;s heat. When the stranger had reached the dwelling-house, he dismounted, and examined various lots of goods. The Hottentots were questioned as to their master, but could afford no information. The slave business was once more in action, and poor Maria racked with agony. The stranger directed his attention to her situation; he looked around for information; I caught his eye, and we recognized each other. I described to him, in a few words, the particulars of the case; and as the sound of--&quot;Two thousand rix-dollars; once -- twice -- third and last time,&quot; proceeded from the mouth of the salesman, the stranger cried out -- &quot;Two thousand one hundred rix-dollars.&quot; -- &quot;Another hundred,&quot; said the slave-dealer; and &quot;Fifty more,&quot; cried an elderly-looking man, with much excited feeling. &quot;I&#39;ll give one hundred more,&quot; said the stranger, with great coolness. A pause ensued: you might have heard a pin drop. Murmurs now burst forth at the expense of the stranger. He was unmoved; his countenance being marked with a fixed determination. The slave-dealer, unwilling to give up the contest, offered another hundred rix-dollars. The stranger doubled it and said,--&quot;She&#39;s mine at any price.&quot; The slave was knocked down to the stranger, and the auctioneer demanded cash.</p><p>The stranger proposed a draft on his agent in Cape Town. This was refused. He looked somewhat perplexed. In my pocket was a packet containing two thousand rix-dollars, (150l.) being a sum of money I was to deliver to a country clergyman. I tendered the money to the stranger, who from his purse added three hundred more. Still we were deficient, and the auctioneer was induced by many around him to shew no favour. Another hundred in silver was produced by myself; still the purchase was not completed. The stranger threw down his gold watch and seals, and the bargain was effected. The poor girl, still concerned for her fate, and knowing nothing of her new master, fell at his feet. He raised her up, and taking her by the hand, he kissed it, and led her to her young mistress. &quot;There,&quot; said he, presenting the poor trembling woman to her young mistress, &quot;take her as your free servant, no longer a slave; take her as your friend and faithful companion; live in peace and happi&shy;ness together. God bless you both; and when you supplicate on high, ask Heaven&#39;s mercy for W---- the Indian.&quot; [Author&#39;s Note: The gentlemen from India, who visit the Cape, are generally called &quot;Indians.&quot;] Without awaiting the thanks of the wonder-stricken group, the stranger mounted his horse and was soon out of sight.</p><p>Thus, Reverend Sir, you have a faint outline of those particulars of which I happened to be a spectator. I often review them with feelings of intense emotion, while I contemplate with ad&shy;miration the benevolence of the Indian visitor, Major W----. In the future scenes of your life, which God grant may be, for your own comfort, in happy old England, I hope you will continue to be useful to poor Africa. You will do more than think over the wicked nature of slavery in this British colony. You will never forget that British-born subjects are identified as goods and chattels, and are mixed up, in all public advertisements for sales, with &quot;household furniture, waggons, carts, horses, mules, sheep, oxen, and pigs.&quot; You have heard much of the comparative mildness of slavery at the Cape of Good Hope; but you have seen, as no unmoved spectator, that to him who is the author of it, and him who is the victim of it, it is alike an evil and a curse. You have seen how completely it has vitiated the very springs of moral and intellectual perception in this colony, and obliterated the sense of its own enormities. You have beheld all this; and I feel assured that you will not fail to give your zealous aid to promote its speedy and utter extinction.</p><p><span style=\"font-style:italic\"><span class=\"placeName\">Cape Town</span></span>,<br /><span class=\"date\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Jan. 5</span>, 1830.</span></p><!--<br />\t  Generated from index.xml using XSLT stylesheets version 7.44.0<br /><br /><br />\t       based on http://www.tei-c.org/Stylesheets/<br />\t       on 2023-05-10T18:47:34Z.<br />\t       SAXON PE 9.8.0.12.<br />\t\t -->", "type" : "literal" }

How many in England wait and watch for the result with intense anxiety and interest! For myself, I feel that the main business of my life is now brought to an end,-- an end which, great as are its imperfections, excites in me the deepest thankfulness. May a blessing indeed be now with it! and may a blessing also richly descend on the nation which has made so noble a sacrifice for the cause of justice! All that remains for us to do is to endeavour cordially to render both the people of England and the negroes contented with it, and to do our utmost for the religious education and instruction of the latter. To this last object I hope all our energies will be directed.<br /><br />Let us not forget how much we may contribute to the perfect success of this great measure. The more I hear and read, the more I am convinced that the negro race are blessed with rather a peculiar aptitude for the reception of moral and religious instruction; and it does seem to me, that there never was a stronger call on any nation than there is now on this to meet this inclination in them; to supply them amply with the means of instruction; to despatch missionaries; to institute schools; and to send out Bibles. It is the only compensation in our power, and it is an abundant one! May we in this manner recompense all the sorrows and sufferings we have inflicted, and be the means of making, in the end, their barbarous removal from their own land the greatest of blessings to them! I am cheered indeed by hearing the note of preparation on many sides: various denominations of Dissenters are preparing their emissaries; the Established Church, I trust, will not be behind; and the Wilberforce subscriptions, which, after the erection of a monument, are to be applied to the foundation of some institution in the West Indies which shall be a more appropriate memorial than marble, will I trust be widely patronized.&quot;<br /><br /><span style=\"small-caps\">T.

      { "value" : "<span style=\"small-caps\">When</span> you fall into company with a christian man, while under the influence of devotion; his passions unruffled by the interests of this life, and his understanding unentangled with their intricacies; he seems as if his soul had been breathing in a milky and fragrant sea of love. The spirit of a system which proclaims &quot;glory to God in the highest, peace on earth, *goodwill to man*,&quot; has inspired him; and with a glow of sacred benevolence, without restraint or reserve, he will tell how &quot;God is love;&quot; how this love in its infinitude dwelt in Christ the Saviour of man, while through atonement to justice and satisfaction of law, it opened to itself a channel, along which, with a free course, it might visit every child of Adam. He will tell you that the essence of that religion which the Redeemer brought from heaven to men is this glorious attribute; that its power is displayed in subduing whatever is fierce,untractable, proud and selfish in the human bosom; and in transforming a heart, before the residence of many a malignant demon, into &quot;a habitation of this God of love through his Spirit.&quot;<br /><br />But mark this same man in other circumstances, in contact with the common affairs of life, and associated with the man of business; especially when on the arena of debate, where temporal interests are discussed, the anomalous claims of various classes of society adjusted, and questions of expediency weighed and determined; -- see him when the efficacy of principle must be exposed to trial, when religion is to go forth from theory to practice, its energy to be teated by acts, and its influence for good brought into competition with the power of example, habit, human friendships, and national institutions; -- what then do you too frequently behold, but the man of secular wisdom, and of less than pagan justice? -- an ordinary man of this world, offering profoundest homage to rank, even to ill-gotten wealth, sympathizing with the oppressor, and not only leaving the victim in his fangs, but insulting the misery he helps to inflict by affected condolence; -- one really engaged in fastening more firmly the chain of bondage, by quoting the Bible in favour of tyranny; but while in the act of driving the iron deeper into the soul of the oppressed, preaching to him submission and contentment with his wrongs.<br /><br />An hour or two has passed, since this professed disciple of Christ beheld his Master adorned in robes of grace, melting with pity, weeping over the miseries of men, even the most guilty; inviting the weary and heavy-laden, and stretching a merciful hand to &quot;break every fetter, to loose every yoke,&quot; and to pour the healing balm into every galled wound. In all this, he saw the Saviour doing the will of the eternal Father, doing nothing from discordant sympathies, nothing apart from his commission, but in the very act of beginning his career of mercy, exclaiming, &quot;Lo! I come to do *thy will*, O God!&quot; Yet now this same disciple has discovered, -- discovered in one short hour, contrary decrees of God, opposing acts of providence; nay, allowance, permission, more than toleration, -- a positive license for proud contempt of a fellow-creature; for a sordid claim of sovereignty over his limbs and spirit; for the prostitution of a being for whom Christ died, into the mere instrument of avarice; for the foulest of robberies; yea, even for certain and wholesale murder, however slowly working may be the violent death.<br /><br />To inflict slavery upon a Brother, to extort his unrewarded labour by the terror of the lash, to brutalize him, to make him our property (as we coolly name the impious deed) to consume his life in unpitied toil, to treat him as made on purpose for us, and given, bound hand and foot, into our merciless gripe by his Creator; -- this we are told is not inconsistent with Christianity, is no sin, has been permitted, nay even recommended by God himself, and remains to this hour the accredited license of the strong against the weak. This we are told by the christian man, by him who just before declared that *God is love*, and that the gift of Christ is the glorious pledge, the proof that love is indeed his very essence.<br /><br />Stay, indignation! repress thy clamour, wait awhile, and learn what strengths of reason may compel us to admit this seeming contradiction.<br /><br />When Christianity obtains its final triumphs, and by consequence, in proportion as it prevails at all times, &quot;The wolf is to dwell with the lamb, the leopard to lie down with the kid, the calf and the young lion together,&quot; as well as the cow and the bear to feed in friendship; but must we not amend our wonted exposition of these figures? It is not, perchance, that the fierce and ravenous are to assume the nature of the meek and innocent; but that, by blending qualities, the lamb and the wolf are to be confounded; the cow, the bear, and the lion, alike in ferocity and devouring selfishness. Can this be true? Then let the infidel triumph, and let us renounce our drivelling about the religion of love! Who, in maintaining contrarieties, can conciliate the respect of common sense, or the approbation of his conscience?<br /><br />If Christianity sanction Slavery, it must at the same time sanction the cruelty and wrong, the misery, and the loathsome forms of human degradation from which it is inseparable, which compose indeed its essence, and which defile and curse every soil where it is planted. Then let us, with a fearless probity, designate this same Christianity by its proper attributes; let us tell the world how it mocks the hope of the benevolent heart; how, instead of elevating our species into the practice of heroic virtue, and urging to generous personal sacrifices for the good of others, it leaves us leagues below humanity, sunk in depths of the meanest selfishness, and the devoted worshippers of that accursed thing, which, with a strange inconsistency, itself denominates the &quot;principle of every evil.&quot; Let us tell the scoffing infidel with manly candour, what it is that we so strenuously commend to his regard. and press on his acceptance; let us pursue him with entreaties, till he embrace the glorious truths which authorize him to do -- what? -- to sail to the West Indies, to purchase an estate of human flesh, to pray and flog, to thank his God and manacle bis brother, to water his plantations with the tears of his fellows, to enjoy the music of wailing and lamentation, to become happily familiar with sights of woe, and enjoy the sweet interchange of devotion and ferocity.<br /><br />But are we truly reduced to this necessity? must we forego the stimulating hope that the world itself is, by the power of Christianity, -- hoped otherwise in vain, -- to become the abode of justice, kindness, love; -- the ennobling thought, that therein is revealed to our contemplation a system of unmingled purity and benevolence; that this system is embodied in the person, character and acts of its great Founder, and that the Christ of whom it testifies has in his life, and partly in his death, left us an example, which he not only calls upon us to imitate, but pledges himself to enable us ultimately to attain? We will not easily be induced to forego this transporting anticipation, nor will we suffer an ambiguous sentence, nor a disputed fact, to repress our ardour. We will not quibble with the advocate, who imagines himself called by duty to justify wrong, but rather endeavour to ascertain the spirit of the enactment; we will interpret what might be doubtful, if alone, -- harmoniously with the main design; and illustrate the obscure by the clear light, -- the steadily-burning lamp of undisputed truth.<br /><br />This is a course so palpably reasonable, that one must be astonished how some minds could ever wander from it, and by so doing plunge amidst morasses and pitfalls, exposing alike themselves and those who trust their guidance to untold danger. If there are insulated passages of Scripture which seem to be exceptions from its general tone and character; who that values consistency, would strain their verbal bearing to what is condemned by every page of the volume; -- to the support of injustice, violence, and mockery of human weakness?<br /><br />Principles of interpretation have, on this question, been adopted, which, if followed out, must banish virtue and happiness from the world; while it is passing strange, that not only professed divines, but even experimental christians, in opposition to the dictates of the inner man, have become apparently their willing patrons.<br /><br />To institute a formal argument, to prove that the word of God has nowhere given to man the license, *at his own pleasure*, to make a slave of his fellow-man, seems indeed to common sense a labour so superfluous, that only demonstration the most palpable that folly not unfrequently thus mingles itself with general wisdom, could warrant the painful and ignominious attempt -- ignominious to those who need it, if not to him who with reluctance undertakes the task.<br /><br />Upon what pretences, then, of scriptural authority do men plead for the lawfulness of holding, *at our own discretion*, a fellow-being in a state of slavery? They are founded on such positions as the following.<br /><br />That Slavery in the *abstract* cannot be unjust, since on some occasions it has been expressly permitted, and on others even commanded; -- that from the beginning, and more explicitly since, part of our race were marked out by a distinctive colour to become victims of the oppression of others; -- that at a recorded period, the Divine Proprietor laid a portion of the human family under the ban of his curse; -- that He decreed, and having decreed, predicted that a certain race should be held as slaves of other races; -- that Slavery, though existing when Christianity was introduced, was not by name definitely denounced; -- that instructions are given to slaves as slaves, by which that state is recognized; -- and that Paul, the great asserter of christian liberty, sent back a vagrant slave to his former master, without demanding his manumission.<br /><br />Let us examine these vaunted proofs, that an opprobrious scheme of perpetrating injury on our fellow-creatures has been introduced and practised under the guarantee of heaven.<br /><br />I. To speak of Slavery in the *abstract*, is to talk but unintelligibly; -- and the difficulty is, to understand from what it is to be abstracted. Is it that the subject of such slavery is abstracted from the iron grasp of his fellow-man; from every usurped claim over his person and unpaid labour; from the infliction of the brand, the scourge, and the fetter; from the blustering villany which degrades his manhood into the unintelligent brute? Is he to be withdrawn from the cupidity, the lust of domination in the master? Is it a case in which, against his own desire, under a sense of solemn obligation from an authority higher than his will, without a sordid feeling, or the least tyrannical love of power, the hapless lord is found encumbered with his slaves? Were such the fact, this slavery in the abstract were tolerable to the slave, intolerable to the master, and would not long, we may presume, be found. The logic of such a holder of property in man would soon be keen enough to find a plausible deliverance. His wit, so sharpened now to defend his grasp, would not be wanting then to counsel him how he might relax his hold. If Slavery can indeed subsist without oppressors, then may there be a slavery in the abstract, which we ought not to condemn.<br /><br />But difficult as it may be to discover what is meant by so obscure a phrase, and yet so often employed by the advocates of slavery; perhaps by attending somewhat closely to the line of defence pursued on such occasions, we may gather, that what is intended is, not slavery *in the abstract*, but just the contrary. As far as we can judge, it amounts only to the acknowledged case, that circumstances may arise, such, that it is not unlawful nor unjust, to hold a fellow-creature in bondage. Whoever doubted of this fact? and by what rule of thought or language is this to be called slavery in the *abstract*, depending as it does entirely upon specific and peculiar conditions from which alone the lawfulness arises? Did any one, save these slavery defenders, ever dream that it was right in the abstract to hang our fellow-creatures, to behead them, to shut them up in prisons, or to chain them in solitary cells, because it has been generally admitted that rebels, murderers, and felons may be so treated? Not unfrequently; indeed, have we heard these slavery-men defend their cruelties by pointing to our prisons and our prisoners, our chained felons and our gibbets; assuming doubtless that Englishmen will take for granted, that these miserable beings are so used upon the principle of abstract right, not upon that of punishment for crimes against society; or at least supposing that the British public can discern no difference between suffering for felony, and suffering for not submitting gracefully to the claim of a tyrant over their persons and unrewarded services. Having succeeded in benumbing to utter insensibility their own perceptive powers of moral distinction, they seem to imagine that the torpor has become universal, and that as suffering is suffering all over the world, Botany Bay and the West Indies make no different associations. Justice and violence, lawful punishment and murder, are in their esteem twin-brothers; and a merciless Planter and a Judge may claim from public esteem and confidence an equal sanction.<br /><br />God, it is said, in some cases -- in that of Abraham for instance, has implied the right to make our fellow-creatures slaves, by giving laws and regulations for its exercise; while, in other cases, as in that of the Israelites, he not only permitted but enjoined it, by commanding them to take of the people of surrounding nations, and to make them slaves. Let us examine this high pretension, -- this boasted patent from heaven in favour of a practice which bears so many marks of a contrary origin.<br /><br />Are we then to infer that it cannot be wrong in the abstract, to extirpate whole nations at our pleasure, to slay utterly, old and young, women and babes, and to take possession of their land, their cattle, and their goods? Does this follow because God, on a special occasion, gave this command to a specific people, against a people also specifically marked and separated to that judgment? Does abstract right arise from cases insulated thus from ordinary rule? Are all the acts performed by the immediate sanction and express authority of God, the undoubted Proprietor and Supreme Judge, to be regarded as examples and public rules of conduct for all mankind? Will the Christian yield to the Infidel the honesty or justice of such an interpretation?<br /><br />The apologist for Slavery, driven by sad necessity, has in his defences learnt the art of knaves; the well known art of slily reversing facts and rules; and many a weak Christian has not been able to detect the fearful trick upon his understanding. To do *no injury*, is, as it has ever been, the abstract rule, or rather to do good to all men; -- the opposite, to inflict evil, is the melancholy exception, then only right, when justice, necessity, general safety, or the express authority of heaven, for a higher end than individual benefit, demands. The Creator, the Preserver of life, the most rightful and universal Lord, possesses without doubt an absolute authority not to be delegated to his creatures. It rests with him to judge, when, where, and how to punish his offending subjects, considered simply as his subjects, not as transgressors against societies of men. Nor is He more restricted in the means than in the power and right to inflict his judgments. He may employ his creatures as his executioners, but woe to those who assume that office without express commission! Power, the most absolute, belongs to God, but never causelessly does he draw the sword of his Almighty Providence, or give the license to his agents to destroy. At length it will be found that &quot;justice and judgment have been the basis of his throne.&quot;<br /><br />But because God is Lord and Sovereign over his creatures, shall therefore man put in his claim to that prerogative? Shall a thing of nought invest himself with his Creator&#39;s attributes, and claim to make his own will his law? Or if not, can our West Indians produce their commission from their Maker to spoil his workmanship, and to degrade into the brute whom God has meant for men? Let them shew the seal of their high warrant. Let them, like Moses, not bring plagues only on mankind, but take them off; let them work wonders of goodness, as well as marvels of evil. What seas have they divided to let the ransomed pass over? From what flinty rock have they given water to the thirsty refugee from bondage? Never have there been wanting men, sufficiently audacious to imitate the *rule*, the *authority*, and *royal state* of the Almighty, -- but if this be piety, then hell itself is peopled with pious inmates. Let then no one so debauch his reason, as to argue, that because under some circumstances, some men have received an implied permission, or even an express command, to hold slaves, -- therefore we, according to the dictates of an imperious will, or the impulses of avarice, may do the like. Fit argument this for tyrants, or for idiots, but frightfully out of keeping for reasonable christian men. In what part of holy Scripture, then, has God conceded to any portion of mankind, the right, the license, the permission, if you please, to employ a power casually accruing to them, *at their own will*, and simply for *their gain*, to enslave their fellow-creatures? This is the question, and we demand a clear, indubitable grant, before we implicate the Bible in the *crime*.<br /><br />But if to hold our fellow-creatures in unwilling bondage be so great a sin, it is replied, why was it not forbidden? The answer is, it *was* forbidden, and it has been punished also.<br /><br />Before the law of Moses, the light of nature, God&#39;s law written on the mind, forbad it; as is most justly held by all the authors best approved and most learned in the laws of nature and of nations.[Author&#39;s note: &quot;Licet unus prae altero variis *dotibus*, animi corporisque \u00e0 natura sit ornatus, non eo minus tamen, legis naturalis praecepta adversus alios ei sint exercenda, atque ipse ab aliis idem expectat; nec ideo plus licentiae, ipsi concedatur, alios injuriis afficiendi.&quot; -- Puffendorf.] And what is the specific crime for which it is recorded that the providence of God so fearfully interposed as to bring the flood upon the inhabited earth? It was this, -- &quot;the earth was filled with violence.&quot; What violence greater can be, than that of depriving a brother-man of all his rights, treating him as our property, and by force and terror making him, body and soul, subservient to our will? If any oppression greater than this is asserted to have been punished by the flood, let us at least be informed how we may conceive of it.<br /><br />The written law of Moses forbad Slavery. Christ, the infallible interpreter, has expounded it to mean, that we should &quot;love our neighbour as ourselves,&quot; and that &quot;we should do to all men as we would that they should do to us.&quot; Explain these maxims as you may, place the utmost limit to their beneficence which shall leave but a particle of meaning in them, and it must follow still, that Slavery, -- Slavery uncaused by crime, by compact, or, if such a thing there can be, by the issues of a war necessarily and justly waged, -- is peremptorily forbidden. That this particular form of injustice should be specifically and expressly named, it were most absurd to demand. Things of a doubtful nature might require a distinct enumeration, but what need of such particularity where hesitation would be inconsistent with the primary distinctions of right and wrong? Christ himself has explained murder to include whatever leads to it, even anger towards a brother without cause. What sort of book had been the Bible, if every sin to which depravity gives rise had been described by some distinctive name? Conciseness, universality, and yet unfailing adequacy to bring conviction to the offender, constitute a part, and no small part, of the innate evidence, that the law laid down in Scripture does really come from God.<br /><br />Jurists, worthy of the name, have unanimously held, that the strong, as such, could by no law of nature assume dominion over the weak; and to one of four causes have ascribed the origin of Slavery. These causes were, violence in the spoliator, crime in the victim, voluntary compact between the parties, and finally, the result of war, undertaken from some urgent cause, and prosecuted rightfully. This cause was deemed to imply a capital offence in the enemy, and to invest the victor with the right to punish with general slaughter. When death was not inflicted, it was transmuted for a state of lasting servitude; and inasmuch as, had the right to kill been exercised, issue had been prevented, it was assumed that children born to the Slaves, become obnoxious to the sad condition of their parents. Consequences so fearful ill accord with our notions of what is just; but, at any rate, being generally known, they might at least have one salutary effect; -- that of deterring from aggression.<br /><br />Whether the slaves possessed by Abraham were exclusively of the latter class, cannot be determined; but as some of them were his by purchase, it is to be inferred that some had been either prisoners of war, or the posterity of such; yet others might have been held by him for life, by stipulation. The case of Abraham, therefore, can supply no extenuation of the Slave-system. He did not employ a lawless power, making his own cupidity the rule, and assuming, contrary to the law of nations, an absolute control over strangers merely because he had the power to do so. If any insinuate the slanderous charge, on him must rest the proof. The Scriptures do not sanction the attempt.<br /><br />Our modern Slavery cannot be legalized. International, universal law forbids, and must annul all compacts to the contrary of its indissoluble obligation; whence, by whatsoever pretended sanction of confederacy, one nation, or one class of men, without wrong previously committed, decree the people of another nation, or the weak amongst their own, together with their offspring, to a perpetual servitude, the act is felony, and chargeable as such on all who but concur in the fraudful plunder. Are we to impute this crime to Abraham? By what rule of evidence or equity is it in our power?<br /><br />Yet it may be admitted that maxims then current amongst mankind might be severe; and that He who is the supreme Judge, might not, for weightier reasons than we can urge, see fit to give specific revelation on such points of practice. *The law*, -- not the moral law of God, but the subsidiary interpositions of divine prescription, -- *made nothing perfect*. This was left for the period when God, having previously instructed us by the prophets, should speak to us by his Son. It was by Him, and by his sanction, that the law, the Moral Law, was to receive its fuller interpretation. Moses suffered, we are told, what Christ did not allow to be in full conformity with the rule originally introduced by God. Revelation is susceptible of degrees. It is an interference on the part of God, not to be claimed as our right, but left to his prerogative of mercy; and fact has shewn that it was not complete at once; but, that much of human knowledge, important as it might be, was left to be developed gradually, by the exercise of thought, and by the progress of events. In all ages men were treated according to the light within their reach, and the advantages possessed by which they might collect it, while these advantages have been from time to time increased, till perfected by Christ himself. The revelation enjoyed by Abraham therefore was not a universal rule of right, but an auxiliary towards a better interpretation of the law of nature, perfect indeed in its degree, but not including all the elucidation which God has since seen fit to grant to man. In the case before us, as far as revelation interposed, it was, be it remembered, for the advantage of the weak, for the benefit of the poor slave, and not to enlarge the license of the master. Common as is the maxim with certain reasoners on such subjects as these, -- that the rule of man&#39;s duty could not extend beyond explicit revelation, or that the Almighty must of necessity approve whatever He did not by his word particularly condemn, -- it is unwarrantable in reason and disproved by fact. Those who have not a written law at all are nevertheless &quot;a law unto themselves,&quot; nor is this law in the least abrogated by any superadditions more or less communicated in another manner.<br /><br />If from Abraham, we turn to the Israelites, we find a clearer enunciation on the subject. They were expressly forbidden to make slaves of their brethren, or *to serve themselves by them for nought*; yet the Israelite might nevertheless become subject to a temporary bondage under his brother Israelite, through the operation of peculiar circumstances. Considering the general provisions of the Jewish law for the distribution or security of property, these circumstances could scarcely occur, without a personal dereliction of care and prudence. Yet whatever was the fault of the unhappy sufferers, their degradation was but short, closing at the utmost at the entrance of the year of Jubilee, and, in the opinion of the most learned divines, even never extending beyond the seventh year. The law is express upon the point in Exodus xxi. 2 : &quot;If thou buy a Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve, but in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.&quot; At the expiration of his term of servitude, the previous bondman was not to go out empty, much less to buy his freedom, but, together with recovered liberty, to have the means to enter upon some plan of regular subsistence.<br /><br />It is commonly said, however, and our translation warrants the assertion, that, of the surrounding nations, the Israelites were not only permitted, but commanded to take slaves. Yet from the forms of speech employed in that language, and the construction of the passages, the Hebrew scholar will deny the justness of the sentiment. The clauses are exceptive, and it was permission, not command. Take it however in any sense, yet, since it was a special case, in which the license must be limited by the express authority by which, for peculiar reasons, it was granted; it cannot touch the cause for the support of which it is alleged. This we have already proved; but we further add the important consideration, that those nations had been previously doomed, some, their iniquity at length being full, to utter *destruction*, and others to *subjugation*, for their malicious hatred of, and direct opposition to, the purposes of heaven, manifestly declared, and ratified by miraculous acts.<br /><br />God had chosen the place and the people, where and by whom He would make known his merciful designs to men. He had determined on the instruments of His high purpose; nor would He suffer that instrumentality to fail. On this account, and for this end, in addition to the mere exercise of distributive Providence, He gave to his chosen people powers and prerogatives, which none may claim by natural right, or on any grounds not clearly and explicitly laid by God himself. And finally, those who were thus subjected to the Israelites were not free men, but already servile, and doubtless in that condition according to established rules of judicature, for they were not to be stolen, but bought with money, which none could be but those whom war had doomed; while in the exchange of masters they passed, by that event, not only under a mitigated system of bondage, but to the privilege of learning the law of life, and of becoming participators in the blessings of the Church of God.<br /><br />II. The pretence that certain portions of our race, distinguished by colour from ourselves, may, on that account, be arbitrarily subjected to bondage, betraying as it does a pitiable ignorance, is rather ridiculous for its folly than formidable for its argument. Men in circumstances of desperate guilt, bribed by their interests or their passions to remain so, endeavour to cheat their consciences by any flimsy sophistry. It is said, that God set his mark upon the victims as he did upon *Cain*. But how came our West Indians to know, that the sign which God gave to Cain that his life should not be taken by the hand of violence, was not by suddenly bleaching him *white*, rather than by turning his skin to black? Our first parents, inhabiting an eastern clime, might, for any evidence to the contrary, be persons of colour; as we certainly know were some of the earliest and mightiest potentates.<br /><br />Was it, moreover, the posterity of Cain who survived the flood? One might imagine, that in the judgment of the Americans, some at least must have escaped from that catastrophe, since they publicly maintain that, by his outward mark, God has for ever designated the white man to honour and rule, and separated this lordly caste from every shade of colour so effectually, that even Christianity cannot re-unite them. Were this merely folly, it might disarm our indignation, but is it not malignant pride? Neither Cain, nor his posterity, as far as we can judge, were slaves, but rather like these haughty oppressors, men of violence, their fathers in rebellion against the fundamental law of God, who &quot;made of one blood all the nations to dwell upon the face of the earth.&quot; Inventors of arts, they were probably no less so of arms, and famous in their day for lust of domination,<br /><br />That the posterity of Ham were marked by any outward sign of reprobation cannot be inferred from any record of them; though from the page of Scripture and the traditions of various nations, we may conclude that they too were once, valiant, ambitious; and, for a lengthened period, little mindful of the rights of other tribes. Some of them have indeed since fallen into helpless misery, and this event was both foreknown and predicted by their Maker; but though the fact, that their fellow-men would hold them in ignominious subjection, was both foreseen and foretold, neither prescience nor prophecy can justify the abominable deed.<br /><br />III. &quot;Cursed shall be Canaan,&quot; is, it seems, the high commission, under which the willing executioner of the Almighty&#39;s judgments may, for his own sordid ends, enslave his fellow man. We are to believe that it is no vulgar passion, no mean love of gain in the Slave-holders, which impels them to an act so abhorrent from their sympathies, but rather an exalted feeling for the glory of the Supreme Legislator, a heaven-inspired zeal, that none of His predictions may want fulfilment. Piety -- who can doubt it? piety works mightily in their devoted hearts; insomuch that, seeing the Almighty needs instruments whereby to accomplish his awards of justice, they -- putting holy violence on their pity, -- they exclaim, Behold *us*, behold *us*, here are *we*, ready to perform thy will, O God! Do they forget that it is generally the *wicked*, whom, in His mysterious Providence, the Most High employs to execute his judgments? And do they not remember that those who, for private ends and from personal pride, become his weapons -- &quot;his hammers, his axes and his saws,&quot; -- to perform decrees, in the justice of which their motives share no part, will themselves incur a yet severer vengeance? How have the lessons of the prophets been lost on these unhappy self-deluders!<br /><br />&quot;Your first father sinned, and thy teachers have transgressed against me; therefore I have profaned the princes of the sanctuary, and have given Jacob to the curse and Israel to reproaches.&quot; Here is the ban of God upon a people. What then? Is any one at liberty to share the Divine indignation, and voluntarily to present himself in the joy of his heart for the work of punishment? Let us hear the sequel of this mournful case.<br /><br />&quot;Assyria is the rod of mine anger, and the staff in their hand is mine indignation. -- Against the people of my *wrath will I give him a charge*, to take the spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the street. Howbeit *he meaneth not so*, neither doth *his heart think so*; but it is in his heart to destroy and to cut off nations not a few. Wherefore it shall come to pass, that when the Lord hath performed his *whole work* upon Mount Zion and upon Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of Assyria, and the glory of his high looks. For he saith, By the strength of my hand I have done it, and by my wisdom; for I am prudent. -- My hand hath found as a nest the riches of the people: and as one gathereth eggs that are left, have I gathered all the land; and there was none that moved the wing, or opened the mouth, or peeped. Shall the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith? or shall the saw magnify itself against him that shaketh it? -- Therefore shall the Lord send among his fat ones, leanness; and under his glory shall he kindle a burning like the burning of a fire. I was *wroth with my people*, I have polluted mine inheritance, and given them into thine hand: thou didst *shew them no mercy*; upon the ancient hast thou very heavily laid thy yoke. -- And thou saidst, I shall be a lady for ever: so that thou didst not lay these things to thy heart, neither didst remember the latter end of it. Therefore hear thou this, thou that art given to pleasures, that dwellest carelessly, that sayest in thine heart, I am, and none else beside me; I shall not sit as a widow, neither shall I know the loss of children: but these two things shall come on thee in a moment in one day, the loss of children, and widowhood: they shall come upon thee in their perfection. For thou hast trusted in thy wickedness: thou hast said, None seeth me. Thy wisdom and thy knowledge, it hath perverted thee; and thou hast said in thine heart, I am, and there is none beside me. Therefore shall evil come upon thee; thou shalt not know from whence it riseth: and mischief shall fall upon thee; thou shalt not be able to put it off: and desolation shall come upon thee suddenly, which thou shalt not know.&quot;<br /><br />Thus far the prophet Isaiah, what saith Jeremiah?<br /><br />&quot;All that found them have devoured them: and their adversaries said, *We offend not*, because they have *sinned against the Lord*, the habitation of justice, even the Lord, the hope of their fathers. Because ye were glad, because ye rejoiced, O ye destroyers of mine heritage, because ye are grown fat as a heifer at grass, and bellow as bulls; your mother shall be sore confounded; she that bare you shall be ashamed: behold, as the hindermost of nations it shall be a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert. Because of the wrath of the Lord it shall not be inhabited, but it shall be wholly desolate: every one that goeth by Babylon shall be astonished, and hiss at all her plagues. Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and deliver every man his soul: be not cut off in her iniquity; for this is the time of the Lord&#39;s vengeance; He will render to her a recompense.&quot;<br /><br />To the same purpose thus speaketh Ezekiel.<br /><br />&quot;Because thou saidst, Aha, against my sanctuary when it was profaned, and against the land of Israel when it was desolate, and against the house of Judah when they went into captivity; Thus saith the Lord God, Because thou hast clapped thine hands, and stamped with the feet, and rejoiced in heart, with all thy despite against the land of Israel; behold therefore I will stretch out mine hand upon thee, and deliver thee for a spoil to the heathen; and I will cut thee off from the people, and I will cause thee to perish out of the countries: I will destroy thee, and thou shalt know that I am the Lord.&quot;<br /><br />Nor less decisive is the language of Zechariah.&nbsp;<br /><br />&quot;O Lord of Hosts! how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the elders of Judah, against which thou hast had indignation, these threescore and ten years? -- Thus saith the Lord of Hosts, I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy, and I am very sore displeased with the heathen that are at ease; for I was but a little displeased, and they helped forward the affliction.&quot;<br /><br />From these concurrent denunciations of the Prophets, as well as from many other parts of Scripture, we cannot but discern the fearful mistake committed by those who proffer themselves so readily to fulfil the divine displeasure, however clearly declared, without express commission. Injustice and wrong, whether perpetrated or approved by us, will meet with no extenuation from the fact, that they are in fulfilment of the Divine decrees. Those decrees are no part of the rule which God has given for the guidance of our life, nor will they, under any circumstances but direct command, peremptorily and explicitly given, as in the case of Abraham&#39;s offering his son, authorize us to violate the everlasting obligation, to &quot;*do justice* and to *love mercy*,&quot; as well as to &quot;walk humbly with our God.&quot;<br /><br />What can be more humiliating to every friend of religion than to hear self-designated evangelical professors, -- the avowed advocates of a system which conveys in on intense bearing on the destinies of man the irradiations of infinite love itself, -- so speaking as if they were afraid of excelling their Maker in compassion! they dare not &quot;undo the heavy burden and let the oppressed go free,&quot; lest by that act they might unwittingly oppose some counsel of the Almighty which dooms their victims to perdition! Such friends of Christianity, by the weakness of their intellect, or the prejudice with which they read the sacred volume, do greater injury to the holy cause which they assume to have espoused, than any its most virulent foes are capable of accomplishing. Greater far than can be told is the danger to which they cannot but expose themselves, and those who listen to their wrestings of the word of God from its benevolent purpose.<br /><br />Did the Jews incur the less peril, or meet with any mitigated indignation from their God, because in crucifying the Redeemer they performed a deed which &quot;His hand and counsel determined before to be done?&quot; Or did their successors meet with sympathy from Paul, when thinking to have repelled his accusations by his reasoning on the unfailing purpose of Heaven, they exclaimed, &quot;Who then hath resisted his will, and why doth he yet find fault?&quot; Notwithstanding the Divine decree, they were *wicked hands* by which the Prince of Life, the Lord of Glory, was crucified and slain; nor were the acts of the same people in subsequent days the less crimes of dark enormity, although not frustrating but fulfilling the Divine purpose.<br /><br />Though it could be proved, therefore, that the Africans do indeed lie under the Divine displeasure; that for causes known to God it is his purpose, that they should become like the Jews, a &quot;by-word and reproach amongst the nations;&quot; -- though it should be granted that the ancient curse has not as yet entirely discharged its quiver against their race; yet would not that fact, though clear as daylight, in the least abate our expectation of those judgments which ever are reserved against oppressors. God&#39;s purposes and those of the guilty spoliators, according as they may in the event, are not in unison; they spring from different motives, are not adjusted by the same rules, nor directed to the same ends; and the result will certainly be, that while He will, at a future day, unfold to open view the justice of his procedure, they must drink, even to the very dregs, the cup of His inexorable displeasure.<br /><br />IV. While some profess to found their apology for a system of slavery upon Divine decrees, others, with a witlessness even more insane, venture an appeal to His mere *predictions*. &quot;Their misery and bondage have been foretold,&quot; say these sagacious christians, &quot;how then can we better approve our zeal for God than by ensuring that misery and taking care to rivet fast the chain?&quot; What crime ever committed by man might not, on this pretence, become a virtue? Does not prophecy embrace the foulest deeds which human agency can perpetrate? When Christ foretold to his disciples the wrongs which they should suffer, did He, by that act, give license to their foes? When John depicted the monster drunk with the blood of saints, did he -- did the Holy Spirit by him, by that very prophecy, excuse the harlot&#39;s bloody deeds? What persecutions, murders, tyrannies, what acts, most foul and deadly, have not been antedated in the page of prophecy? If to predict, then, is to justify, we are at once provided with apology for deeds the most malignant which men or devils ever can perform. Farther they cannot go, than when they fulfilled the oracles which told of the *sufferings* of Christ, as well as of the glory that should follow,<br /><br />V. But Slavery, we are reminded, was in being, and not definitely by name denounced, when Christianity itself was introduced. Are we then for ever to be babes, -- never to be trusted with an inference, -- never excited in religion to call forth the faculty of reason? This master-principle, so necessarily active in every other department of our being, that life itself, and all that gives it value, are suspended on its exercise; must, it seems in this, in this, the greatest of affairs, in ascertaining the will of God and human duty, be for ever dormant. We must have the very words which literally describe, or peremptorily forbid, all shades of crime, or guilt will not attach to the wrong-doer. Will these infantile commentators maintain the hope, that they can excuse their babyism at the bar of the last Judge? Will they then escape the sentence fated to go forth -- the &quot;wrath revealed&quot; against &quot;all *unrighteousness*,&quot; as well as &quot;ungodliness of men?&quot; Are all the other forms of unrighteousness, all of ungodliness, specifically marked? And is not this sufficiently depicted? Is not every master enjoined to give to his *doulous*, -- his *slaves*, as these commentators at least will have it, whatever is *just* and *equal*? And what says James to these men of wealth, -- of wealth wrung from the sinews of their brother men? --<br /><br />&quot;Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for the miseries that shall come upon you. Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are moth-eaten. Your gold and silver is cankered, and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. *Ye have heaped treasure for the last days*. Behold, *the hire of the labourers* who have reaped down your fields, which is of you *kept back by fraud*, crieth, and the *cries* of them that have reaped have *entered into the ears* of the Lord of Sabaoth. Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have nourished your hearts, as for a day of slaughter; ye have condemned and killed the just, and he *doth not resist you*.&quot;<br /><br />Listen, Slave-holders! -- hearken, ye that justify the wicked, either with or without reward for the atrocity, -- listen, till your ears tingle! Is not this a scriptural net, close enough and strong enough to secure you? Break through its meshes if you can, but sleep not within its dread enclosure; mistake not, sottishly, the dream of safety for deliverance.<br /><br />But you give your slaves food, and clothing, and medicine; you do not suffer them to die of famine or nakedness, or to become absolutely exhausted for want of respite or refreshment. So did these doomed tyrants, else how were their fields reaped, or their victims capable of labour? Where are the *wages* of your slaves, their just reward for toil, their willing agreement to exchange their well-directed strength for compensation? Is not this just remuneration, &quot;of you kept back by fraud?&quot; Do not you, by grinding down their vigour with work and torture, with imprisonment and chains, because not obedient to your absolute control; -- do not you continually &quot;kill the just, who cannot resist you?&quot; Do you not live in pleasure, and become wanton amidst these mournful scenes? Are you not, then, nourishing your hearts for the day of slaughter? Have the cries of those who have reaped ceased to enter into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth? And what think you will be your aggravated doom, for charging these deeds of pride and avarice upon the sanction of the Judge, the pretended license of Christianity?<br /><br />VI. Yet, say you, can it be denied that instructions were given to slaves, as slaves, to be obedient to their masters, and that not only to the good and gentle, but even to the froward? Does not this, then, recognize slavery? It is allowed that the Scriptures *recognize* a state of slavery, and honour the poor slave prodigiously, by expecting from him the noblest acts of christian heroism; -- the most difficult of all conquests, even over the strongest feelings of the human bosom, for the sake of Christ. But do those Scriptures therefore justify the foul despot, who, without crime or previous compact, brands and manacles a fellow-man, and otherwise, by force and terror, holds him fast in bondage? To recognize the existence of a fact, -- is this to authorize the doing of it? Why blink the question? When the Scriptures teach us to do good to those who persecute us, who evil entreat us, and despitefully use us, they recognize a state of persecution, but do they justify the persecutors? When Christ teaches his disciples to be glad and rejoice under such circumstances, does he, by these encouragements, cheer on their haughty enemies, invite the hand of violence to its fierce deeds, and include the oppressor with the oppressed in the honour and happiness which so graciously he pledges? At what time shall we meet with such infatuation as when the oracles of heaven are to be expounded? Yet, &quot;at least,&quot; you say, &quot;the slave is not called upon to redress his wrongs, or to assert his liberty.&quot; This, no doubt, must give you some contentment, even under the justly excited dread of future retribution. It is true there is one who hath said, &quot;Vengeance is mine, I will repay;&quot; and the christian slave, helpless as he is, may safely leave his cause to the never-dying justice of heaven.<br /><br />But where, in the New Testament, is any man called upon to assert his rights in opposition to violence? Where are christian nations, or any nations, whatever the provocation, encouraged to make wars? Where are our slave-holders, or any men, called to defend their right of *property*, of which they talk so loudly, unblushingly denominating such their miserable captives? Are not men in general exhorted rather to suffer wrong than forcibly to repel injury? What then? Is it therefore unlawful to recover debts, to defend rights, to vindicate our claims to personal liberty against despoilers? Will these men thus interpret the law of Christianity?<br /><br />On every occasion, but when the helpless are to be maltreated, these schoolers of the slave can wield another logic, and, by other lights, can read the word of God. Then they can talk of just and necessary wars, of patriotic slaughter, of magnanimous defenders of our altars and our thrones. Then they can discover that Christianity does not betray the rights of men -- does not protect invaders of those rights; -- that it rather assumes a natural sense of injury, which will scarcely fail, when opportunity shall come, sufficiently to repel aggression; -- and that to moderate its fierceness, to assuage its raging fires, is most in character with that commission which brought down pardon for the guilty, and taught how love could suffer for objects the most undeserving of its pity. This heavenly system purposes to prove its strength by an apparent weakness, and to vanquish pride and cruelty by meekness and untiring patience. Such triumph it has often won, and glory infinite will follow these its wondrous conquests. But when the pretended Christian himself demands new victims, calls for unceasing miracles of patient suffering, and would seek a shelter from retribution either from God or man, by making opportunities to exercise the passive virtues, insulted goodness must itself ere long be roused, and dire will be the day, when its bright blade of justice shall be unsheathed.<br /><br />VII. Finally, we are told that Paul sent back Onesimus, a slave, to Philemon, a Christian master, and therefore Christians may hold slaves, and that deserters, when converted, must return to slavery: this we are told too, on his authority, who has said, &quot;If thou canst be free, use it rather;&quot; and who himself asserted, with manly vigour, his own rights, rebuking the magistrates, and saying, &quot;They have beaten us uncondemned, and now they would thrust us out privily; nay, verily, -- let them come themselves and fetch us out.&quot; Is this the man to sanction slavery?<br /><br />What, then, was the condition of Onesimus? Was he really a *slave* at all? He is indeed called *doulos*, but amongst the learned the meaning of this word is not determined. Potter, no mean authority, denies that it was in Greece applied to slaves; nor is it likely, according to the genius of the christian system, that the apostles should denominate themselves the *slaves* of Jesus Christ. Of slaves also, who might really bear that name, there were various classes;[Author&#39;s note: Vide Puffendorf, cap. iv. De Off. Dom. et Servil.] and amongst them those who, by voluntary engagement, had obliged themselves for life. Some, moreover, were called *douloi*, who were merely bound to certain services, not constant, but occasional, arising out of claims reserved for privileges or benefits conferred. Under which of the descriptions must we rank the case of Onesimus? Will our opponents prove that he was a stolen slave, or the descendant of such a one; or rather, must we not infer, that, though called by that name, he had, by virtue of a compact, come into that condition?<br /><br />Did Paul recognize him as such a slave, that to abstract his services were, as our West Indians ingeniously have it, to *steal himself*, and to forfeit life for the felony. Why then ask, &quot;IF he hath wronged thee?&quot; Was not that IF absurd in any sense in which our colonists could regard the act of a slave absenting himself from the daily task?<br /><br />Do they not universally maintain that mere withdrawment is a flagrant wrong? Do they not for this inflict the torture of some hundred lashes, and sometimes death itself? What means Paul&#39;s IF, then? It means that Onesimus could not be a slave, or else the Apostle was a most unlearned slavery magistrate.<br /><br />But does the sacred writer really send him back to slavery, even if he had been a slave? Does he, in the spirit of American christianity, deny that he can, though a christian, become a brother? He sends him back to *liberty*, with full assurance of his legal manumission, because he knows a christian&#39;s heart. He is assured that he will be regarded as no longer a slave, but a brother beloved. But lastly, as an Apostle of Christ, and therefore under the authority of the christian religion, could he not *command* the master to manumit his slave? Our West Indians, and their apologists, say, NO; but the Apostle himself says, YES. &quot;Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ, to *enjoin* thee that which is convenient, yet, for love&#39;s sake, I rather entreat thee, being such a one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.&quot; Beautiful specimen of meekly bearing, and of tender affection! But if Paul could command, whence his authority, but from Christ? Could he do so simply as a man, or as an aged man, or as a friend? Do these circumstances warrant commands to yield up rights? If, then, by the authority of his apostleship, Paul could command in this case, though he chose to entreat, how can Christianity sanction the slave-holder? Could he, by the same authority, *enjoin* the unwilling forfeiture of property, or the abdication of dominion, justly held and lawfully administered? Who will venture the assertion?<br /><br />From the review of what has been alleged from Scripture, to screen the worst of crimes from public reprobation; alleged too, boldly, openly, at all hazards, by the professed friends of revelation; though, according to the judgment of all our writers on its evidence, in such a case, even revelation itself must have been discarded as a cheat; we find no trace of any support to such flagitiousness, as that of holding, without cause, at our own will, and for our own interest, a fellow-creature and his offspring in perpetual bondage. Positive proofs to the contrary are abundant, and have been often cited. They need not, as for want of space they cannot, be repeated here. The whole spirit of the sacred book, as a directory for man, from its first page to its last sentence, breathes the opposite of violence and cupidity, breathes benevolence and love. &quot;Glory to God in the highest, peace on earth, and goodwill to man,&quot; is its burthen. Christianity and the modern slave system can, by no possibility, amalgamate, till right and wrong shall be intrinsically confounded, till love and cruelty shall mingle natures, or till heaven and hell, without a gulph between their coasts, shall but include one common domain.<br /><br /><span style=\"small-caps\">Joseph Gilbert</span>.<br /><br /><em>Nottingham</em>.", "type" : "literal" }

      { "value" : "A fondness for flowers is characteristic of the coloured Creoles of the Spanish colonies. On holidays, the groups of young people who seek in the evening the savannahs for recreation, among other devices for pastime employ themselves in weaving garlands and singing improvisatore songs. When in Haiti, I never visited the savannahs of St. Jago de los Cavalleros, on such occasions, without observing, in the sort of natural bowers with which the lawns are interspersed, some company of young persons gathered together, and amusing themselves in this way. In addition to this characteristic affection for the blossoms of the field and the forest, the Hispaniolian females make use of natural flowers, (particularly those that expand in the evening,) as ornaments for the head. The assertion made by persons who have visited those colonies, that these chaplets are not unfrequently intermingled with fire-flies confined in gauze bandages as a substitute for brilliants, is not to be charged as a traveller&#39;s tale. The following little effusion is an attempt to embody some of these traits, in the supposed chant of a Hispaniolian or Haitian girl, sent to gather a garland for her sister, but who purposely spares the night-blooming Marvel of Peru, a plant whose pretty, rough, oval seeds, supplying children with materials for necklaces, is particularly cherished by them.<br /><br />Wake up from thy sunset bower,&nbsp;<br />Spread thy leaves my pretty flower;&nbsp;<br />Spread thy leaves, unclose thine eyes,&nbsp;<br />For the silver moon doth rise,<br />And the golden stars are coming,&nbsp;<br />And the beetle&#39;s at his humming,&nbsp;<br />And the moth is from his bed,&nbsp;<br />And the cricket from his shed,&nbsp;<br />And the fire-fly comes to roam,<br />With his lanthorn-light from home,&nbsp;<br />Briskly wandering here and there,&nbsp;<br />Up and down and every where,&nbsp;<br />Whispering to each flower he sees,&nbsp;<br />What a night, without a breeze!", "type" : "literal" }

The visualisations below are prototypes that are meant to show what is possible with network analysis tools.&nbsp;There are several ways to visualise this project using alternative network visualisations. The idea of this section is to offer multiple pathways into discovering various elements of the digital edition.<br /><br />The network graph below maps all of the connections between pages in this project. These connections include places, people, topics, types of document, genre, and other semantic categories. By clicking on a dot (or a node) you will see a &quot;View&quot; button that allows you to investigate further the individual nodes and their page contents.<br /><br /><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9;\">Blue</span>&nbsp;</strong>dots are published pieces in the anthology with &#39;textual paths&#39; (i.e., manuscript versions).&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#27ae60;\"><strong>Green</strong></span> dots are <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://iiif.io/\">IIIF</a> media pages of the manuscript pages relating to published anthology pieces. <span style=\"color:#f39c12;\"><strong>Yellow</strong></span> dots are pages in the anthology without a child relation (i.e. without a page nested within it).&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#e74c3c;\"><strong>Red</strong></span> dots are semantic tags (people, places, genres, thematic categories).<br /><br /><a data-widget=\"visualization\" data-viscontent=\"page\" data-visrelations=\"all\" data-visformat=\"force-directed\" data-size=\"large\" data-align=\"center\" data-caption=\"none\" class=\"inlineWidget inline\" name=\"scalar-inline-widget\"></a><br /><br />The graph below takes a subset of the full network graph above and shows only the relationships between tags (red dots), which might be helpful for identifying &#39;semantic connections&#39; between documents such as place names, genres, or themes. For example, selecting the red semantic tag for &quot;Correspondence&quot; shows you connections to all letters; selecting the &quot;Domesticity&quot; tag shows all documents with domestic themes (family, motherhood, e.g.); or selecting the &quot;Liverpool (England)&quot; tag shows you all documents connected to Liverpool.<br /><br /><a data-visformat=\"force-directed\" class=\"inlineWidget inline\" data-visrelations=\"all\" data-caption=\"none\" data-widget=\"visualization\" data-viscontent=\"tag\" data-size=\"large\" data-align=\"center\" name=\"scalar-inline-widget\"></a><br />The information in the full network graph can also be rendered in a linear &quot;tree&quot; format (if you hover over the visualisation you can zoom in or out). Moving from left to right, the tree visualises how the collection is organised and nested within the edition&#39;s four main categories (Paths, Pages, Tags, Media Files). The individual nodes (dots) are listed in alphabetical order. Selecting a node will either reveal or hide its nested contents.<br /><br /><a data-viscontent=\"all\" data-visformat=\"tree\" data-align=\"center\" class=\"inlineWidget inline\" data-widget=\"visualization\" data-visrelations=\"all\" data-size=\"large\" data-caption=\"none\" name=\"scalar-inline-widget\"></a><br />&nbsp;", "type" : "literal" }

      { "value" : "<span style=\"small-caps\">It</span> is presumed there will be few amongst the readers of these brief memorials unacquainted with the fact and with the principal causes of the late insurrection in Jamaica. When the origin and practical details of Colonial Slavery are duly considered, no reflecting persons will be surprised at any violent sallies of misguided passion into which the oppressed may be betrayed on the one hand; nor at the atrocious efforts of tyrannous power, on the other, to repress the rising hope of freedom, and reduce its vassals to absolute and hopeless subjection. The history of Slavery, in all ages and in every country, is one of equal crime and suffering: -- a history, from the contemplation of which the just and the good instinctively recoil, and the termination of which, all who believe in a just and retributive providence must forebode as pregnant with desolation and sorrow.<br /><br />Within the last fifteen years, some progress has been made in the general enlightenment of the Slaves. By the labours of missionaries many children, and some of the adults, had received a rudimental education. By their evangelical ministrations many were brought to the &quot;love of the Truth,&quot; became holy in their lives, and fearlessly resigned themselves to all the consequences of a devout and conscientious deportment. The transformation of negro character which was thus effected, the solicitous attention evinced to religious duties, and the necessary sanctity of character, and regularity of conduct which a christian profession involved, offered too severe and too frequent a rebuke to the managers of Slave-properties to be endured with patience, and too often thwarted their unbridled passions to be long tolerated.<br /><br />It cannot be denied that the truly religious Slaves had far surpassed their brother bondsmen in mental culture, nor that they had a clearer perception of their natural rights, and an equally intense desire for their personal freedom: but they, nevertheless, reined in their convictions and natural propensities by a filial trust in God&#39;s providential superintendence; and disciplined their souls to the habit of patient endurance, by the example of their suffering Redeemer, and by the assured hope of &quot;Eternal Life,&quot; the ultimate solace of the weary and oppressed. The chain of slavery, always heavy, was to them made thrice more galling, from their professed subjection to the Holy Jesus; and stripes were inflicted upon them &quot;beyond measure,&quot; for no reason but that they would not &quot;cast away their confidence, which hath great recompense of reward.&quot;<br /><br />If the hapless, defenceless Slaves thus suffered for their &quot;obedience to the Truth,&quot; it will be naturally concluded, that the instruments of their illumination and conversion were not allowed to pass with impunity. It is known to have escaped the lips of some of the colonists, that the next or coming insurrection would be charged to the account of the missionaries. By this and other inuendoes it has been clearly perceived, that the planters themselves designed to create some commotion, whatever were the precise character they wished it to assume, or whatever might be the exact limits to which they might deem it expedient it should be urged. Their own violent proceedings in the legislative assembly, in which they impugned the wisdom, and condemned the authority of the parent government, recklessly denouncing and rejecting every meliorative decision of His Majesty in Council, or studiously rendering it nugatory: -- by peremptorily refusing to make a provision for the manumission of the Slaves, when they themselves could present the price of their freedom, and their refusing to consider the expediency of abolishing the custom of publicly flogging women with the cart-whip; -- the intemperate manner in which many of the planters expressed themselves at public meetings, reprobating His Majesty&#39;s Government, and all the designs of the benevolent public in Britain; -- the extreme incaution and bitterness with which the Attorneys and Overseers expressed themselves at their own tables, in the hearing of the Slaves, upon the subjects of emancipation and religion; -- the cutting gibes and sarcasms with which they uttered themselves upon these subjects, when they put the slaves down for punishment, together with some other arbitrary proceedings at Christmas, 1831, were the true causes of the insurrection. The Planters, however, were true to their purpose of implicating the Missionaries, and the writer of the following paper, the Rev. W. Knibb, was one of the victims of their lawless violence.<br /><br /><span style=\"small-caps\">Eustace Carey</span>.", "type" : "literal" }

      { "value" : "An Account of the first Introduction of the Gospel among Negro-&shy;Slaves in the West-Indies, by Voluntary Christian Missionaries.<br /><br />I<span style=\"small-caps\">n</span> the early part of the last century, a negro&shy; slave, on the Danish island of St. Thomas, fre&shy;quently sat, after the labours of the day, on the sea-shore, and earnestly sighed for a knowledge of the gospel, concerning which he had caught some imperfect notions from the professions of Europeans, though no man cared for his soul, or for the souls of thousands of his fellow-sufferers perishing for lack of knowledge. It was not long after he had fallen into this train of feeling, that his master took him away from the island, and brought him to Copenhagen. There he heard the good tidings of great joy, which are unto all people; he believed them, and was baptized into &nbsp;the death of Jesus, by the name of Anthony. Then, immediately, his soul yearned with affection and sympathy towards his sister whom he had left, a slave in the plantations; and he longed to make her a partaker of the same blessedness which he knew.<br /><br />About this time, meeting with some pious companions of Count Zinzendorff, who had arrived at the court of Denmark to attend the coronation of Christian VI., Anthony broke his mind to them, saying, &quot;Oh! that some one would go and preach the gospel to my sister in St. Thomas!&quot; These good persons introduced him to the count, who being a man of gracious manners, and one who from his youth had cherished a hope of sending the gospel to the heathen, hearkened eagerly to the representations of Anthony, that if preachers were sent to the island, not his sister only, but many of the slaves there would gladly receive them, and might in the end be converted from the error of their ways. Count Zinzendorff had lately become the patron of a small body of refugees from Moravia, the remains of the ancient church of the United Brethren, who had found an asylum from persecution on his estate in Lusatia. There, in the midst of a forest, they had built a few humble habitations and a place wherein to worship God in peace, after the manner of their forefathers, who, for centuries, had been &quot;a poor &nbsp;and afflicted people, whose trust was in the Lord;&quot; while from generation to generation they kept up a succession of martyrs and confessors of the truth, amidst the darkness of superstition in their native land.<br /><br />On the count&#39;s return to Herrnhut (the new settlement, whose population did not yet exceed six hundred persons), he communicated to the little congregation, at their daily evening meeting in the chapel, what he had learnt in his interview with the converted negro. While he yet spake, the hearts of two of his hearers, &nbsp;Tobias Leopold, burned within them to go forth, and be the messengers of salvation to Anthony&#39;s sister. These young men were inti&shy;mate friends, yet neither of them spake to the other on the subject that night, but cherished the fervent desire, each alone in his own bosom, praying and weeping over it till morning, when they met, and, to their mutual surprise and delight, on comparison found, that &quot;as face answereth to face,&quot; so did the heart of the one to the other, and &quot;as iron sharpeneth iron,&quot; so each sharpened the countenance of his friend. In the evening, while they and others of the young men of the congre&shy;gation were returning from the usual walks which they took in the forest, for private prayer and spiritual converse, Count Zinzendorff was stand&shy;ing at the door of his lodging, in company with &nbsp;the Rev. Mr. Shaeffer, a pious clergyman, who happened to be on a visit at Herrnhut; when, as they passed, two and two, towards their homes, the former turned to the latter, and said, &quot;My dear friend, there are, amongst these brethren, messengers who will go forth to preach the gospel in the West Indies, Greenland, Lapland, and other heathen countries.&quot; This prophetic saying was the more remarkable, because no plan had yet been contemplated, nor was indeed likely to be undertaken, by these christian exiles and emi&shy;grants from various quarters, seeking rest for themselves with liberty of conscience, in that solitary place. Nevertheless, the two friends, who had made up their minds for the service of the Lord among the negroes, were encouraged by that saying to offer themselves for the work, first in a letter privately addressed to the count, and afterwards openly to the congregation.<br /><br />In the course of a few weeks the negro, An&shy;thony, himself arrived at Herrnhut, and confirmed, at a public meeting there, all that he had stated at Copenhagen, respecting the wants and the willingness of his ignorant and oppressed country&shy;-men in St. Thomas, to receive the gospel: but, he added, so long and so severely were they worked by their masters, that, unless those who went to preach to them would consent to become slaves themselves, and labour with the negroes in &nbsp;the plantations, they would have little opportu&shy;nity of communicating divine instruction to them. This intelligence did not in the smallest degree daunt the devoted young men; they were both ready, not only to be bound, but to die for the Lord Jesus. Such indeed was the simplicity of purpose, singleness of heart, and strength of faith, by which they were actuated, that they were willing to make any sacrifice which might be required, if they could win but one soul to Christ,--nay, if they might but have the opportunity of carrying the news of salvation to Anthony&#39;s sister,--a poor despised female slave.<br /><br />Difficulties, however, with regard to the prac&shy;ticability of the attempt, among their brethren and sisters, whom they were bound to consult and reconcile to it, occasioned the delay of a full year. At length the perplexity of the congrega&shy;tion became so great, that the elders resolved to &quot;cast the lot into the lap,&quot; and leave &quot;the whole disposing thereof&quot; with &quot;the Lord,&quot; (Prov. xvi. 33.) according to the practice then and ever since observed in their church, in the appointment of ministers, and for the decision of other important affairs. Prayer having been made,--out of several scriptural sentences, suitably chosen, &nbsp;the following, &quot;Let the lad go up:&quot; &quot;The Lord is with him.&quot; This put an end to<br />&nbsp;all scruples, and he was forthwith set apart for the missionary enterprise. The faith and patience of his friend were put to longer proof: Tobias Leopold drew a text which intimated that he should &quot;tarry by the stuff:&quot; and he submitted, expecting that his time would come, when his way should be made clear. Meanwhile, David Nitschman (who had first fallen in company with Anthony at Copenhagen) was invited, and con&shy;sented to be Leonard Dober&#39;s fellow-traveller to the West Indies, with the view, after seeing him settled at his post there, to return to his family at Herrnhut.<br /><br />Little preparation was needed for the journey: their brethren and sisters could furnish them with no outfit but their best counsel and their fer&shy;vent prayers. Those prayers, however, &quot;availed much,&quot; for they were the prayers of faith, and that counsel was the wisest, which man, instructed by God, could give in such a case. It was literally this:--&quot;In all things remember to follow the guidance of the Spirit of Christ.&quot;<br /><br />Accordingly, on the 21st of August, 1732, like their Redeemer at the beginning of His ministry, &quot;in the morning, rising up a great while before it was day,&quot; they &quot;went out and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.&quot; (Mark i. 35.) At three o&#39;clock, &quot;when it was yet dark,&quot; (John xx. 1.)--the hour about which Mary Magdalene came to the sepulchre and found that her Lord was already risen,&shy;--these first messengers of his resurrection to the negro-slaves in the West began their pilgrimage on foot, each with his staff and his scrip, accom&shy;panied by Count Zinzendorff through the forest. At the place for parting, having commended them to God and the word of his grace, he said, &quot;Bre&shy;thren, what money have you for charges by the way?&quot; They produced three dollars, and the count (whose whole income was expended in the cause of religion, and therefore always kept low,) added two ducats, making their whole stock about thirty-one shillings and sixpence. And this was the first missionary fund for preaching the gospel to the heathen, upon that plan which has since been adopted by almost all denominations of evangelical Christians!<br /><br />With these small means, they proceeded on their journey to Copenhagen, six hundred miles; hoping, when they arrived there, to be allowed to work their passage across the Atlantic on board some West Indian merchantman. On the road, having letters of recommendation, they called upon several pious friends, who hospitably enter&shy;tained them, and bade them &quot;God&#39;s speed&quot; when they departed, but who gave them no encourage&shy;ment to hope that they should succeed in their design of carrying the gospel to the slaves. In fact, they rather disheartened the poor missionaries, by starting doubts and difficulties, to which they themselves gave no heed, except in so far as they saw that others were affected by the con&shy;sideration of them.<br /><br />One devout lady, the countess de Stolberg, at Werngerode, alone appeared to view their project with favour. Having anxiously inquired into all particulars concerning their object and their prospect of obtaining it, she looked with compas&shy;sion on the young man, Leonard Dober, and tenderly asked him a mother&#39;s question,--&quot;How could you bear to leave your aged parents be&shy;hind?&quot; He soon satisfied her, that it was from no lack of love to them, that he was going at his peril among strangers and savages, and that they would not want what little he might have been able to spare for them had he remained at home. She then, according to a practice frequent at that time among religious persons, requested him to draw a text of Scripture, on the occasion. He opened to these words, &quot;Hearken, O daughter! and consider, and incline thine ear; forget also thine own people, and thy father&#39;s house.&quot; (Ps. xlv. 10.) The countess was deeply affected, and instantly said, &quot;Go your way, and should they even put you to death, the Lord Jesus is worthy that his servants should be ready to lay down their lives for Him.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;These words,&quot; said Leonard Dober, writing to the same lady, several years afterwards, &quot;were a balsam to my heart, which before had been almost broken by the discouragements which others had thrown in my way. Your Excellency and Count Zinzendorff were the only persons who spoke comfortably to me!&quot; What a preparation of mind for suffering, self-denial, and self-sacrifice was here! and how little besides these was ex&shy;pected, when it was counted all joy to be told that, if their enemies killed them, their Master was worthy that they should die for Him! Their spirits indeed had been wounded,--wounded in the house of their friends; the scorn of the world they could well endure, but the want of faith among the people of God was hard to bear, by those who were themselves so strong in it, on the subject of their mission to the Gentiles.<br /><br />On their arrival at Copenhagen, they had to encounter fresh trials. Their scheme was re&shy;garded by all with astonishment; and while some mocked and others pitied them, they were con&shy;tent to be &quot;accounted fools for Christ.&quot; Their idea of labouring in the plantations as slaves, especially, was condemned as the height of infa&shy;tuation. But they patiently persevered in apply&shy;ing for license to go to St. Thomas, and to obtain a passage by some vessel bound thither. The latter was absolutely refused to them, on board of any of the Danish West India Company&#39;s ships. Meanwhile, the report of their errand to Copen&shy;hagen having reached the ears of the royal family, through Counsellor Pless, who from their arrival had kindly treated them, though he (like others) found it difficult to comprehend what spirit they were of, or how they could hope to accomplish the aim of their undertaking, the queen and the Princess Amelia condescended to desire an inter&shy;view with them. To these august personages, the two humble disciples of a crucified Saviour told their simple story with such effect, that they were dismissed with the most gracious assurances of the royal good-will and future protection. The princess afterwards sent them a sum of money towards their expenses, and a large Dutch Bible. The latter gift proved peculiarly seasonable, and the apparently adverse circumstance of their being refused admittance on board of any Danish vessel, and being compelled to take their passage in a Dutch one, was not less beneficial in the result. The negroes in St. Thomas (the island having been formerly a colony of Holland) spoke a barbarous broken Dutch dialect,--the mission&shy;aries spoke German; of course, without some preparation on the part of the latter, they would not have been able to make themselves under&shy;stood by the slaves on their landing: but, though the crew of the vessel at first dealt roughly with them, Dober and Nitschman soon so conciliated the rudest, by that measure of &quot;the meekness and gentleness of Christ&quot; which they manifested, that, during the voyage of more than two months, the sailors delighted to help them in every way they could, especially in turning their German phrases into Dutch. They sailed from Copen&shy;hagen the 8th of October, and reached St. Thomas on the 13th of December following. Previous to their departure, the Lord had given them such favour in the eyes of several persons, high in office at the Danish court, that, besides furnishing them with the means of paying for their passage, and procuring tools requisite for carrying on their respective handicrafts, they dismissed them with these words, &quot;Go, in the name of God. Our Saviour chose fishermen for preachers of the gospel; He himself was a carpenter, and called the Carpenter&#39;s Son!&quot;<br /><br />It is recorded, that on the first appearance of the shore of St. Thomas, on which their hearts had been so long fixed, and to which their thoughts had been travelling every day with intensity of desire,--they were seized with pe&shy;culiarly depressing emotions. This was not the failure of faith, but the fulness of joy, overflow&shy;ing and presenting the symptoms of grief,--for the extremes of gladness and sorrow meet in this kind of feeling which they produce, and are expressed in the same language of tears, which, in return, yield relief to both.<br /><br />They landed on Saturday; and next day,--the third Sunday in Advent, on which the Gospel in the Lutheran Church (as it is in the Church of England) was, from Matt. xi. 2&ndash;15,--John the Baptist&#39;s message of inquiry to Christ, and our Saviour&#39;s answer, &quot;The poor have the gospel preached to them:&quot;--they went in search of the &quot;one lost sheep,&quot; (Anthony&#39;s sister,) whom they had come so many weary miles by sea and land to find in the wilderness, that they might bring her back to the good Shepherd who had laid down his life for her. After a little inquiry they reached the plantation on which she with her husband were located. Having delivered the salutation of her brother; at the desire of the parties, they opened and read a letter from him to his sister, in which, among the quotations from the New Testament, was the following: &quot;And this is life eternal, that they might know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent.&quot; (John xvii. 3.) The Brethren began, then, at that same Scripture, and preached Jesus and the resurrection to the blacks, who had gathered round them while they were in conversation with Anna and Abraham, as Anthony&#39;s sister and her husband were called;--christian names being preposterously given to heathen slaves, to whom the name of Christ himself was never declared. To this little company, after having told in few words, as well as they could, what the Lord Jesus had done and suffered to redeem perishing sin&shy;ners, they said,--&quot;For you also our Saviour has procured this salvation, and we are come hither on purpose to bring you the glad tidings!&quot;<br /><br />Notwithstanding the German-Dutch in which they spoke, the poor negroes understood the drift of their discourse, and clapped their hands at the conclusion, in token of their joy at the message. Hitherto they had thought that such good things were all reserved for the white people. And was there not joy in heaven also among the angels of God, when, for the first time, the &quot;faithful say&shy;ing, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners,&quot; was made known to these children of Ham, suffering under the curse upon their father, and who &quot;straightway received the word with joy?&quot; There was probably not a humbler spectacle on earth, in that hour, nor one from which the wise of this world would have turned away with more contempt, than two fugitives from the heart of Moravia, the strong hold of corrupt Christianity, preaching Christ crucified, in a broken dialect be&shy;tween their native tongue and a strange one, to an audience of Africans, who themselves spoke a jargon yet more barbarous, and had to strain their rude faculties to comprehend either the meaning or the sentiments of the address to them:--yet it may be believed that there was not a scene then exhibiting throughout this fallen world, more beautiful in prospect from the throne of God than this, when the first sickle was put into the harvest, which, since then, through a hundred successive years, has been yielding fruits in abundance, and beyond all precedent in any other Gentile field, where labourers sent by the Lord have gone forth. On a certain occasion it is written:--&quot;In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said,--I thank thee, O Father! Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes; even so, Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight.&quot; (Luke x. 21.) And can it be doubted, that in &quot;the joy that was set before Him,&quot; when &quot;He endured the cross, despising the shame;&quot; that part of &quot;the travail of his soul&quot; was now seen by Him, in this commencement of gospel-preaching among negro slaves in the West Indies?<br /><br />Here then &nbsp;upon the ground on which he had set his affections, when he for&shy;sook his father&#39;s house, and all the comforts of christian society: but here, like Abraham in Canaan, (called like himself by God out of his own country,) he had &quot;none inheritance; no, not so much as to set his foot on;&quot; (Acts vii. 5.) and, like his Redeemer, whom he had thus far followed out of the camp, bearing his reproach, &quot;he had not where to lay his head.&quot; Though the spirits of himself and his companion had sunk on the first sight of the island whither they were sailing, they no sooner found themselves among the people to whom they went, and engaged in the work for which they came, than their hope in God revived, and in the multitude of their thoughts his com&shy;forts delighted their souls.<br /><br />Now, just while they were deliberating how they might contrive to lodge and live as cheaply as possible in that neighbourhood, Mr. Lorenzin, a planter, sent a message to the strangers, inviting them to take up their abode in his house, and promising to furnish them with all necessaries and comforts till they could provide for themselves. Their hearts and eyes overflowed with gratitude to their heavenly Father, who, knowing that they had need of such things, was thus graciously pleased to remind them, that they should take no anxious thought for the morrow, while they were engaged in his business. They were the more deeply affected with this offer of hospitality from one on whom they had no claim, when they considered that they had come hither under the expectation of being obliged to sell themselves for bond-slaves, and toil with the negroes, in order to do them any good. Thankfully, therefore, they accepted the kindness of their new-found friend, but providentially they had not long occasion for it.<br /><br />David Nitschman, being a carpenter by trade, soon found abundance of good employment, by which he was enabled to maintain both himself and his brother; for Leonard Dober, who was a potter, could find no clay in the district which he could work into serviceable vessels of any kind; his skill, therefore, profited him nothing. Mean&shy;while they availed themselves of every oppor&shy;tunity to shew the negroes that they came among them to do them good; and, though they had much to encounter, of jealousy on the part of some of the whites, and of contempt and disregard on the part of many of the blacks, in patience they possessed their souls, and were exceedingly en&shy;couraged, when, from time to time, they perceived that they laboured not in vain, nor spent their strength for nought. Anthony&#39;s sister and her husband were early awakened by their testimony, and others gave evidence that the word of God was making its way in their hearts, by the change which was wrought by it in their walk and con&shy;versation.<br /><br />But they had been little more than five months on the island, when an opportunity of returning to Europe occurring,--for intercourse between Denmark and those distant colonies was unfre&shy;quent in those days,--David Nitschman, accord&shy;ing to previous agreement, took advantage of it, though much pained to leave his friend alone. Leonard Dober, however, on no account, would detain his journey-companion from his family. After making a slender reserve for his voyage, Nitschman left the small surplus of his earnings with Dober, for his maintenance, till he should find some means of supporting himself. The latter had not long to wait for this; he served a gracious Master, who soon provided bountifully for him.<br /><br />The governor, Herr Gardelin, hearing that the solitary missionary was thus circumstanced, sent for him, and engaged him as a tutor of his little children, took him into his house, and placed him at his table. Leonard Dober accepted the situa&shy;tion on the express terms, that he should be allowed, after his daily duties in the family, to visit the negroes wherever he could gain access, and teach, as he might have opportunity, the whole counsel of God.<br /><br />In the cool of the evening, then, was the voice of the Messenger of Salvation wont to be heard, like &quot;the Lord God&quot;&#39;s of old, &quot;walking in the garden of Eden.&quot; Here indeed it was &quot;the voice of one crying in the wilderness,&quot; &quot;Prepare ye the way of the Lord; make straight in the desert a highway for our God.&quot; And did the sinners who heard it after the toils of the day, where, under the primal curse, they were eating bread in the sweat of their brow, on a soil which to them brought forth little besides thorns a&micro;d thistles,&shy;--did <em>they</em>, like guilty Adam and his consort, when they heard that voice, run to hide themselves in the bushes? No; they heard and hailed the joyful sound; they learned to know and love it too; and, weary and heavy-laden as they were with the yoke of bondage, and sinking under the burthen of unrewarded labour, they ran forth from their huts to welcome it; and when the minister of Him who was &quot;meek and lowly in heart&quot; came to offer them &quot;rest for their souls,&quot;--the only rest the slave could hope to know in this life; the pledge, however, of rest eternal in the presence of God,--they ran forth from their poor huts, exclaiming in heart, if not in words, &quot;How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of Him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace!&quot;<br /><br />But Dober being visited with the fever which usually attacks strangers in those tropical regions, and which suspended his evangelical labours for awhile, grew dissatisfied with himself, that all his time, strength, and energies, had not been de&shy;voted to these. His tender conscience reproached him, when he compared the ease and luxury of the governor&#39;s mansion, in which he &quot;fared sumptuously every day,&quot; with the condition of a field-negro, to which he had in anticipation deter&shy;mined to stoop, that he might give every moment he could seize, where such moments were so few and so precious, to the ministry of the gospeL He sunk under the humiliation of these thoughts, and when he had recovered from that temporary sickness, respectfully but earnestly prayed for his dismissal from his Excellency&#39;s service. This was reluctantly granted.<br /><br />He then hired a little lodging at a place called Tappus, and earned a scanty maintenance by acting as watchman on some neighbouring plan&shy;tations, and performing other small offices, which enabled him to procure bread and water, and little more, to sustain life. Amidst deep poverty, he was quite happy, because he was free, and the word of God not bound. Great blessing con&shy;tinued to accompany his humble, fervent, faithful preaching, and after-years shewed that much of the good seed which he had sown by all waters, and on every kind of ground, had taken root, sprung up in due season, and bore manifold fruit. A year and a quarter had elapsed since his companion, David Nitschman, had left him, and, in all that time, he had heard nothing from his brethren in Germany, though as often as ships from Europe had come, at long intervals, to the colony, he had anxiously inquired for letters. On the 24th of June, 1734, intelligence being brought that a vessel had just arrived, he despatched a negro to ask the usual almost hopeless question; but the latter not returning so early as he wished, and the night coming on, he went himself to the harbour, and being weary, sat down by a watch-fire, at the way-side, to wait for his messenger. While he was musing, three men, whom he had not perceived coming, stood before him. He looked up;--one of them was his friend and brother, Tobias Leopold, who, with seventeen other missionaries, including the wives of four of the party, were come from the congregation at Herrnhut, to be stationed, some in St. Thomas, and the rest in St. Croix, an adjacent island, recently planted by the Danes. Dober and Leopold wept over each other at meeting, like David and Jonathan at parting. They afterwards spent the whole night in conversation on the subjects most dear to their hearts,--the progress of the church of God to which they belonged at home, and the prospects of that church among the Gentiles in the slave-islands, which Leonard Dober had already begun to build upon the foundation of the pro&shy;phets and apostles, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner-stone.<br /><br />Here this narrative must break off.<br /><br />* * * * * * *<br /><br />During the first years of the mission in St. Thomas, great hindrances, and occasional per&shy;secutions were raised by some of the planters, to prevent the preaching of the gospel to the slaves. For several months in 1739, the missionaries, under false accusations, on which they were brought to trial, were cruelly held in prison; nor were they liberated, till Count Zinzendorff, in the latter year, arriving in St. Thomas, applied to the governor in their behalf, and obtained their im&shy;mediate enlargement. When the count returned to Europe, he was entrusted with two petitions,&shy; the one from the negro-men to the king of Den&shy;mark, the other from the negro-women to the queen. These very petitions, supported by a representation from the count, when he reached Copenhagen, had so happy an effect, that a royal ordonnance was passed, dated August 7, 1739, securing liberty and protection to the Brethren in preaching to the slaves in the Danish colonies.<br /><br />The documents are well worth preserving. The following are exact translations:--<br /><br />&quot;<span style=\"small-caps\">To His Majesty the King of Denmark.</span>&quot;<br /><br />Most gracious Lord King!<br /><br />&quot;Now we hope that your Majesty will com&shy;mand that we may continue to learn to know the Lord Jesus. We remain immovable, if it please God our Lord; though we are greatly oppressed by men, who beat us and cut us, when Herr Mar&shy;tinus (<em>Massa Martin</em>) teaches us. They burnt our books, and say, &#39;Negroes must not be saved; a baptized negro is fuel for hell-fire.&#39;<br /><br />&quot;They have put the brethren, whom God hath sent to us, and who are the only survivors of twenty, for three months, into the fort, and now they intend to drive them out of the country. They all appeal to your Majesty, and say, you have forbidden that the negroes should be made acquainted with our Saviour, and would shortly send Massa Martin away. But we do not believe this; and we pray your Majesty to allow us to be instructed in the knowledge of the Lord, and to remain in connexion with the Brethren&#39;s church, for we wish to go with them to our Saviour.<br /><br />&quot;We will he obedient to our masters in all things; we only wish to send our souls to heaven to the Lord Jesus. <em>Formerly we have cheated our masters, stolen provisions, run away, and been idle. But now things are quite different, as our masters themselves know very well. Many a negro, for his wicked deeds, has resolutely suffered his hands and his feet to be cut off; we will cheer&shy;fully put our necks under the axe for the Lord Jesus, if our masters, as they say, will kill us.</em><br /><br />&quot;God the Lord bless our gracious king a thousand times!<br /><br />&quot;Written in St. Thomas, the 15th day of Fe&shy;bruary, in the name of more than six hundred and fifty scholars of Lord Jesus, who are taught by Massa Martin.&quot;<br /><br />Signed by <span style=\"small-caps\">Peter</span>, and three other Negro&shy;-Assistants.<br /><br />----<br /><br />&quot;<span style=\"small-caps\">To Her Majesty the Queen of Denmark</span>.<br /><br />[<em>Written by <span style=\"small-caps\">Magdalene</span>, one of the female Negro-Assistants</em>.]<br /><br />&quot;<span style=\"small-caps\">Great Queen</span>!<br /><br />&quot;When I was in Papaa, in Africa, I served Massa Mahu; now, when I am come into the land of the white people, they will not suffer me to serve the Lord Jesus. The white people will not obey Him, and they may do as they please; but when the poor black brethren and sisters wish to serve the Lord Jesus, they are looked upon as maroons (run-away negroes).<br /><br />If it seemeth good to the queen, may your Majesty pray the Lord Jesus for us, and also pray the king, that he would permit Massa Martin to preach the word of the Lord, that we may learn to know the Lord, and that he may baptize us negroes.<br /><br />&quot;The Lord preserve and bless you, together with your son and daughter, and the whole family; I shall not cease praying to the Lord for you.<br /><br />&quot;Written in the name of more than two hun&shy;dred negro-women, who love the Lord Jesus.&quot;<br /><br /><span style=\"small-caps\">James Montgomery.</span><br /><br /><em>Sheffield</em>.", "type" : "literal" }

After adopting and discarding various topics, as<br />connected with the general question, the simple form of expression<br />which heads the following stanzas, occurred to me, and was the<br />germ from which every other thought proceeded. I could view<br />Slavery in no other light than that of one continued system<br />of oppression and terror, and therefore, have considered it in its<br />effects, as operating both on matter and mind - on man, in his<br />health and spirits - on man, as amenable to the civil law, and<br />as a professing christian - operating on every relation of life, whether<br />civil, domestic, or religious -- and its, tremendous results, in reference<br />to the just judgments of a sin-avenging God. In order to produce effect,<br />I have aimed more at strength than ease; and if I shall<br />have produced anything capable of imparting either satisfaction<br />to yourself or aid to the cause, it will be sufficient for me<br />to know, with the female in the gospel, that though I have<br />not done what I would, I have done what I could and<br />that little has been accepted. With christian regards to the<br />family,</p><div class=\"closer\">I am<br />With the utmost Respect<br />Your Obedt Servant<div class=\"signed\">James Everett<br />Manchester.<br />June 14th

class=\"l\">resurps an universal reign.</div><div class=\"l\">Away, like righteous Lot, in fear</div><div class=\"l\">Nor tarry those in all the plain.</div><div class=\"l\">Away, for through the Western Isles</div><div class=\"l\">Which sprang from occan&#39;s bed in smiles</div><div class=\"l\">damon stalks, and claims the whole</div><div class=\"l\">Like him who once to Edon stoll</div><div class=\"l\">And spread the blight of death.</div><div class=\"l\">His music is the victim&#39;s cry,</div><div class=\"l\">The shrivelling glance is in his eye,</div><div class=\"l\">Infection in his breath.</div></div>&nbsp;<div class=\"lg\"><div class=\"l\">Talk not of joy, where slavery reigns.</div><div class=\"l\">Of brightning hopes midst &quot;hope deferr&#39;d,</div><div class=\"l\">The negro&#39;s joys are huny in chains</div><div class=\"l\">The negro&#39;s hopes are all interrd:</div><div class=\"l\">He sees the writing on the wall</div><div class=\"l\">In laws, enacted to enthral</div><div class=\"l\">And seems, in every drivers hand</div><div class=\"l\">To see, upon the desert sand</div><div class=\"l\">The lion&#39;s fatal pan</div><div class=\"l\">And in the voice of men of blood</div><div class=\"l\">To hear the voice that shakes the wood,</div><div class=\"l\">And holds the soul in awe</div></div>&nbsp;<div class=\"lg\"><div class=\"l\">Foul Misery, like a blast from hell,</div><div class=\"l\">Hath forced throughout the soul its way</div><div class=\"l\">As mighty tempests when they swell</div><div class=\"l\">And toss on high the ocean spray</div><div class=\"l\">And every flood in maniac form</div><div class=\"l\">Becomes the plaything of the storm</div><div class=\"l\">Still driving onward, still the tide</div><div class=\"l\">Hath burst the vessels rampart side</div><div class=\"l\">Through which the torrents pour --</div><div class=\"l\">And pour like cataracts from the rocks</div><div class=\"l\">Tremendous as the earthquake&#39;s shocks,</div><div class=\"l\">While all her dungeons roar</div></div>&nbsp;<div class=\"lg\"><div class=\"l\">The face which once was full and round</div><div class=\"l\">Where health sat smiling through the jet,</div><div class=\"l\">And eyes, still more expressive found</div><div class=\"l\">Are sunk, like suns, untimely set.</div><div class=\"l\">But deeper shadows than the skin</div><div class=\"l\">Like musts, from troubled thoughts within</div><div class=\"l\">Arise, to dim the joyous sight,</div><div class=\"l\">And fret away the frame of might,</div><div class=\"l\">without the power to flee</div><div class=\"l\">Those shadows -- sudden as a squall --</div><div class=\"l\">Flit o&#39;er the face, and darken all</div><div class=\"l\">Like winds across the sea.</div></div>&nbsp;<div class=\"lg\"><div class=\"l\">Lo, in the precincts of the court</div><div class=\"l\">where Justice only should preside</div><div class=\"l\">To blacks, for proof, will none resort</div><div class=\"l\">The white man&#39;s oath is ne&#39;er denied</div><div class=\"l\">Though undefiled the negro&#39;s hands</div><div class=\"l\">In lifeless silence still he stands</div><div class=\"l\">His inward spirit shrieks unheard,</div><div class=\"l\">And needed like the wailing bird,</div><div class=\"l\">Upon some lonely tower</div><div class=\"l\">While Terror, from his lurid seat,</div><div class=\"l\">And withering as the lightnings heat,</div><div class=\"l\">Descends supreme in power</div></div>&nbsp;<div class=\"lg\"><div class=\"l\">To slaves -- except the christian few</div><div class=\"l\">The Sabbath&#39;s holy calm is lost</div><div class=\"l\">And these, their weekly toil pursue</div><div class=\"l\">With minds, by human tempests tost.</div><div class=\"l\">Their boding thoughts, from various ills,</div><div class=\"l\">Like floods amidst the wildest hills</div><div class=\"l\">Which rage throughout the lengthen&#39;d night.</div><div class=\"l\">Rush headlong from their fearful height,</div><div class=\"l\">and seek the stream that flows;</div><div class=\"l\">For, stooping from its dreary place,</div><div class=\"l\">The mind sweeps trough the means of grace,</div><div class=\"l\">Till fury finds repose</div></div>&nbsp;<div class=\"lg\"><div class=\"l\">But oft, ere that repose is found</div><div class=\"l\">The men of Belial crowd the road</div><div class=\"l\">And dare to visit holy ground,</div><div class=\"l\">And stand among the sons of God:</div><div class=\"l\">Where damon art the balance holds</div><div class=\"l\">To weigh the truth the priest unfolds,</div><div class=\"l\">or basely -- and by civil test</div><div class=\"l\">Confound the freedom of the blest,</div><div class=\"l\">With freedom to the slave</div><div class=\"l\">And boldly charge that priest to flee,</div><div class=\"l\">Or try, with cruel mockery,</div><div class=\"l\">And doom him to the grave</div></div>&nbsp;<div class=\"lg\"><div class=\"l\">The negro, branded at the mart</div><div class=\"l\">Pours forth in vain the rending sigh</div><div class=\"l\">A single bid will quail his heart,</div><div class=\"l\">And sever each domestic tie:</div><div class=\"l\">And where soe&#39;er his feet ^shall roam,</div><div class=\"l\">His manhood ne&#39;er will know a home!</div><div class=\"l\">No wife to sooth or raise his head.</div><div class=\"l\">No infant babes to cheer his shed</div><div class=\"l\">Or fan affections flame</div><div class=\"l\">His grave is distant and alone</div><div class=\"l\">The spot to wife and babes unknown,</div><div class=\"l\">-- No tablet for his name!</div></div>&nbsp;<div class=\"lg\"><div class=\"l\">Not one of all the infant throng</div><div class=\"l\">That lies upon a mother&#39;s knee,</div><div class=\"l\">But gives to agony -- a tongue,</div><div class=\"l\">Unknown to children of the free,</div><div class=\"l\">Unknown to those, whose tears but flow</div><div class=\"l\">From transient fits of tiny woe,</div><div class=\"l\">And who, like troubled sea birds, cry</div><div class=\"l\">While passing through the stormy sky,</div><div class=\"l\">And then -- upon the wave --</div><div class=\"l\">As softly fall as gleams of light,</div><div class=\"l\">And float in beauty to the sight,</div><div class=\"l\">All fearless of a grave.</div></div>&nbsp;<div class=\"lg\"><div class=\"l\">Ah, no! to babes in slavery born,</div><div class=\"l\">Few are the seas and skies serene,</div><div class=\"l\">All ruthless, from a mother torn,</div><div class=\"l\">Her weeping image still is seen;</div><div class=\"l\">Nor less her voice they seem to hear</div><div class=\"l\">In lingering tones on Memory&#39;s ear</div><div class=\"l\">Now echoing sweet -- now wildly roll</div><div class=\"l\">Through all the regions of the soul,</div><div class=\"l\">-- Then, soft -- and far away --</div><div class=\"l\">Like music on the midnight lake</div><div class=\"l\">Till, starting from the dream, they wake</div><div class=\"l\">To misery, a prey</div></div>&nbsp;<div class=\"lg\"><div class=\"l\">Nor say, the mother cannot feel</div><div class=\"l\">At whom the poisoned dart is flung;--</div><div class=\"l\">The body owns the quivering steel</div><div class=\"l\">The tortured wild-cat loves her young:</div><div class=\"l\">And can she from her babes depart,</div><div class=\"l\">Whose life-strings twine around her heart, --</div><div class=\"l\">Those babes, whom nature e&#39;er must own</div><div class=\"l\">As flesh of flesh and bone of bone,</div><div class=\"l\">And part without a pang?</div><div class=\"l\">O, no; -- employ the scourge, the knife,</div><div class=\"l\">And tear the limbs and threaten life,</div><div class=\"l\">On these she still must hang.</div></div>&nbsp;<div class=\"lg\"><div class=\"l\">Away, away, for terror here</div><div class=\"l\">Usurps an universal reign,</div><div class=\"l\">Where parents, children, live in fear</div><div class=\"l\">And walk upon their kindred slain.</div><div class=\"l\">Away, -- for now those beauteous Isles,</div><div class=\"l\">With breath of balm and face of smiles,</div><div class=\"l\">-- which yet had man&#39;s Elysium been,</div><div class=\"l\">Had man himself not changed the scene,</div><div class=\"l\">Are threatened from above;</div><div class=\"l\">And judgment, though it linger long,</div><div class=\"l\">Will burst in wrath for Afric&#39;s wrong,</div><div class=\"l\">And now begins to move.</div></div>&nbsp;<div class=\"lg\"><div class=\"l\">Away, -- for men of blood have piled</div><div class=\"l\">The fabric of their guilt so high</div><div class=\"l\">That dark, o&#39;er Isles, which e&#39;er had smiled,</div><div class=\"l\">It spreads its shadow to the eye.</div><div class=\"l\">Away, -- for Vengeance springs to birth,</div><div class=\"l\">And with the whirlwind sweeps the earth,</div><div class=\"l\">And bears, like autumn leaves away</div><div class=\"l\">The men of guilt, whose iron sway</div><div class=\"l\">Held innocence in chains.</div><div class=\"l\">Away, -- for down the fabric falls</div><div class=\"l\">The voice of blood for justice calls,</div><div class=\"l\">And God in Vengeance reigns.</div></div>&nbsp;<div class=\"signed\">James Everett.<br /><span class=\"placeName\">Manchester</span><br />June 14th 1826</div><p>P.S.

I have tried<br />but I can accomplish nothing<br />I did indeed once string couplets<br />and do now &amp; then put a few rhymes<br />together still but then, I have<br />never sought them -- they have<br />come unasked, and unexpected<br />&amp; now that I [deleted word]? have earnestly<br />desired them -&ndash; they refuse to obey<br />my call -- &amp; every effort has<br />utterly failed.

I But<br />independently of these things, I<br />could not but think I should go<br />to him with a poor[?] face, to ask[?]<br />his help when as yet I had done<br />nothing my self.

      { "value" : "<span style=\"small-caps\">It</span> was at one of those bountiful, social, and exhilarating breakfasts, for which the city of Dublin is justly renowned, when the pious and the benevolent are convened for accelerating their great objects, that a Secretary of one of the Missionary Societies attracted the attention of the whole assembly, by relating a circumstance contained in letters which he had just received from Western Africa.<br /><br />A Negro-slave, on the River Gambia, the property of a French lady of the Roman Catholic Church, had been brought to experience deep and serious religion, under the preaching of a missionary. It soon appeared that the Great Head of the Church had raised up this sable disciple to be an instrument in His hand to accomplish the purposes of His mercy. Powerfully feeling his debt of gratitude to his Redeemer, and commiserating the lost condition of his afflicted brethren of the Jaloff tribe, the pious African began earnestly to exhort them, in their own language, to turn from their sins and seek in Christ Jesus that true freedom which had broken his spiritual bonds, and brought into his soul an inward heaven. His labours were crowned with great success; many of the slaves on the same plantation with himself became christian converts, and consequently, more valuable servants. This their mistress had the candour to allow; and being informed of the instrumentality of Pierre Sallah, her own negro, in the salutary change that had taken place among the slaves of her estate, she allowed him, at his earnest request, to visit the neighbouring plantations, and preach, within a more enlarged sphere, &quot;the unsearchable riches of Christ.&quot; The wretched slaves, on all sides, heard of a Heavenly Benefactor, who looked on their misery with an eye of compassion, and said, &quot;Come unto me, all ye that are weary and heavy-laden, and ye shall find rest unto your souls.&quot;<br /><br />The progress of his usefulness was noted by his observant mistress, and, though she did not forsake the bosom of her own church, she had too much respect for the religion inculcated by her slave, to restrain his labours; and, on being questioned as to her willingness to accept a ransom for him, she said, her esteem for Pierre Sallah was very great, and that his faithfulness and his industry might lead her to demand a considerable sum for his manumission; but that, impressed as she was with a sense of duty in allowing him to continue in his useful office of religious instructor, she would accept of the mitigated sum of fifty pounds for his liberty.<br /><br />Every one present thought, &quot;Surely fifty pounds might soon be raised for the accomplishment of so great an object!&quot;<br /><br />The breakfast was over, and the gentlemen dispersed. The wife of one of the Missionary Secretaries thought it might be worth while to attempt a commencement of the ransom, by an appeal to the benevolence of the ladies who remained in the apartment, and in such a way as to secure a trifling contribution from all. She, therefore, put a sixpence into a saucer, and requested the same sum from each: thus, the first sovereign was raised. In the evening, at a public missionary meeting, Pierre Sallah&#39;s story was told, and the sovereign held up as the first-fruits of the ransom, while a warm address was made to the hearts of all present. Nothing more was necessary in a city where all that moves the soul is flame from the altar in a righteous cause. A voice from one side of the platform said -- &quot;I subscribe five pounds.&quot; Another said, &quot;Put me down three.&quot; &quot;No,&quot; said the zealous pleader,<br /><br />&quot;It is money in hand that I hold, and that is better than promises.&quot; The five pounds, and the three, were immediately passed to the table. This brought notes, gold, and silver, from the gallery in a shower, amidst the acclamations of the assembly; and when the long-continued inundation ceased, and the money was counted in breathless silence, a voice of transport exclaimed -- &quot;Pierre Sallah is free!&quot; Every heart bounded with joy, the luxury of benevolence thrilled every bosom and gleamed in every eye, while the roof echoed long and energetic applause. A voice from below cried, &quot;Pierre Sallah shall be an Irishman!&quot; -- and assent was clapped with laughter.<br /><br />This happened in August, 1830; and in August, 1833, the Secretary&#39;s wife, who collected the first sovereign at Dublin, received a box of shells, and other curiosities, from the River Gambia, containing the calabash used by Pierre Sallah when a slave, neatly carved, engraved with his initials, and inscribed to Mrs. ----, &quot;with a thousand thanks for her exertion in his behalf.&quot;<br /><br />What English bosom will refuse sympathy with the glowing heart thus rewarded for a trifling service! And who will not appreciate the delicacy of the grateful boon, conveyed with blessings from the hand of the liberated slave, now the free and accredited minister of Christ!<br /><br /><span style=\"small-caps\">D.

Yet such is the perversion of heart and intellect to which mankind are liable, that some persons have contrived to persuade themselves that their Christian duty, in reference to this subject, lies in <span style=\"font-style:italic\">absolute inaction</span>.</p><p>In the first place, they urge as a plea for their non-interference, the curse pronounced by Noah on Canaan. <span class=\"quote\">&lsquo;&quot;Cursed be Canaan,&quot; said the offended patriarch, &quot;<span style=\"font-style:italic\">a servant of servants shall he be to his brethren</span>.&quot; <span class=\"bibl\">(Gen. ix. 25.)</span>&rsquo;</span></p><p>Since the person by whom Noah had been offended was not Canaan, but his father Ham, it is taken for granted by these objectors that &quot;Canaan&quot; is here put for &quot;Ham.&quot; And since Ham, <span style=\"font-style:italic\">through his son Mizraim</span>, was the progenitor of the Africans, they conclude, first, that the prophecy is accomplished in the slavery of the negroes; and, secondly, that <span style=\"font-style:italic\">therefore</span> in labouring for the emancipation of the negroes, we labour against the declared decree of the Lord of all the earth.</p><p>Now supposing the application of the prophecy to the African race to be the true one, what can be more absurd than such a practical inference? The duration of Canaan&#39;s servitude is a subject on which the prophecy says nothing, much less does it contain the slightest intimation that their cruel bondage was to have no end. Who, then, shall say that the time is not come for the extermination of African Slavery? or who can deem it unreasonable to suppose, that, in effecting this object, God may be pleased to make use of human instrumentality?</p><p>But I can by no means assent to such an interpretation of the prophetic record, which I believe received its accomplishment when the Canaanites, who were left in the land of Palestine, became &quot;hewers of wood and drawers of water&quot;--the degraded performers of laborious offices--to their Israelitish conquerors, who were themselves descended from Shem. It is highly probable, also, that many of these Canaanites were exported from Tyre and Sidon, and became slaves to the European nations, the descendants of Japheth. <span class=\"quote\">&lsquo;&quot;And he said, Blessed be the Lord God of <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Shem</span>, and Canaan shall be his servant: God shall enlarge <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Japheth</span> . . . . . . . and Canaan shall be his servant.&quot; <span class=\"bibl\">(Gen. Ix. 26, 27.)</span>&rsquo;</span></p><p>Thus utterly vain is the first plea of our objectors; but here we come in contact with a second plea:--<span class=\"quote\">&lsquo;&quot;The Israelites held their fellow men in slavery, a practice in which they acted under the authority of their inspired legislator.&quot;-- &quot;Both thy bondmen and bondmaids which thou shalt have, shall be of the heathen that are round about you, which they begot in your land, and they shall be your possession. And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit them for a possession; they shall be your bondmen for ever.&quot; <span class=\"bibl\">(Levit. xxv. 44&ndash;46.)</span>&rsquo;</span></p><p>It is the natural right of every man to possess his own person; and, provided he abstains from injuring other men, to dispose of it as he pleases: and it is completely at variance with this right, that any man should assume a property in the person of his neighbour. But in the case of the Israelites, this natural right was suspended by the decree of Nature&#39;s Author. The Canaanites who dwelt in the land, and the heathen captives, became the inheritance of the Israelites, by the especial gift of God,--a gift which settles all questions of right. But where is the divine decree,--where is the deed of gift,--which bestows the African race, as bondsmen and bondswomen, on the European nations? Every one knows that our Colonists possess no such authority for slave-holding, and that the title by which their supposed property in slaves originated, was nothing better than the most atrocious avarice, fraud, and cruelty.</p><p>But although slavery was allowed among the Israelites, it was in a lenient and gentle form, wholly apart from the horrors of British colonial bondage. Israel had known &quot;the heart of a stranger in the land of Egypt;&quot; and therefore the &quot;stranger within his gates,&quot; though a hewer of wood and a drawer of water, was to be treated with kindness and consideration. <span class=\"quote\">&lsquo;&quot;Thou shalt neither vex a stranger nor oppress him, for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.&quot; <span class=\"bibl\">(Exod. xxii. 21.)</span>&rsquo;</span> <span class=\"quote\">&lsquo;&quot;And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not vex him, but the stranger which dwelleth with you shall be as one born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself.&quot;&rsquo;</span> <span class=\"bibl\"><span class=\"bibl\">(Lev. xix. 33, 34.)</span></span></p><p>Still more mitigated was the form of slavery among the Israelites, when their fellow-countrymen became their bondsmen. The bondsman in that case was, in fact, not so much a slave as an apprentice; the money paid for him was the hire for his service during a certain period; and, on the recurrence of the sabbatical year, he was, by the divine law, left at liberty. He might then leave his master or continue with him, according to his own pleasure. <span class=\"bibl\">(Exod. xxi. 2.)</span></p><p>The Israelites were not permitted to steal men and sell them, as many professing Christians do in the present day. <span class=\"quote\">&lsquo;&quot;He that stealeth a man and selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, be shall surely be put to death.&quot; <span class=\"bibl\">(Exod. xx. 20.)</span>&rsquo;</span> Neither were they permitted to maltreat or mutilate their slaves, as some of our Colonists do. <span class=\"quote\">&lsquo;&quot;If a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his maid, that it perish, he shall let him go free for his eye&#39;s sake. And if he smite out his man-servant&#39;s tooth, or his maid-servant&#39;s tooth, he shall let him go free for his tooth&#39;s sake.&quot; <span class=\"bibl\">(Exod. xxi. 16.)</span>&rsquo;</span> They were all to unite in keeping holy festivals before the Lord. <span class=\"quote\">&lsquo;&quot;Thou shalt rejoice before the Lord, thou, thy son, and thy daughter, and <span style=\"font-style:italic\">thy man-servant, and thy maid-servant</span>, and the Levite that is within thy gates, and <span style=\"font-style:italic\">the stranger</span>, and the fatherless, and the widow that are among you, in the place which the Lord thy God hath chosen to place his name there.&quot; <span class=\"bibl\">(Deut. xvi. 11.)</span>&rsquo;</span> With these heart-cheering precepts,--with this charitable and edifying practice,--we shall do well to compare the martyrdom of the Missionary Smith, the lawless destruction of meeting-houses, the savage cry of political church-unions, and the flogging of slaves almost to death, for the crime of attending a place of worship and of praying to God!</p><p>&quot;But, finally,&quot; say the objectors, &quot;slavery is nowhere forbidden by our Saviour or his apostles, and may therefore be surely permitted under the gospel dispensation,&quot; as if the gospel dispensation annulled, instead of confirming, the rights and liberties of mankind!</p><p>True indeed it is, that neither our Saviour nor his apostles interfered with the then existing constitution of civil society. The kingdom which Christ came to establish was the kingdom of heaven; and the freedom which he graciously condescended to proclaim was freedom from condemnation and sin. Nevertheless, the law which he enforeed on mankind was, in every just respect, <span style=\"font-style:italic\">a law of liberty</span>; and the great principles of his holy religion are radically opposed to all abuses, both of a moral and a civil nature.</p><p>With regard to slavery, and especially such slavery as degrades our West Indian colonies, it is utterly at variance both with the <span style=\"font-style:italic\">doctrines</span> and with the <span style=\"font-style:italic\">precepts</span> of Christianity. Admit that the injured descendants of Africa are destined for immortality, and are redeemed by the precious blood of the incarnate Immanuel, and you will no longer tolerate the notion that they are mere goods and chattels; you will no longer endure a system, under which they are worked to death, whipped and branded, at the pleasure of their owners!</p><p>Acknowledge the golden rule, &quot;<span style=\"font-style:italic\">Do unto others as ye would that others should do unto you</span>,&quot; and the bonds of iniquity must be broken. Just in proportion to the degree in which the precept is obeyed, will true liberty, charity, and peace prevail among mankind; and should it arise into its native and full dominion, <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Slavery</span> will finally and for ever disappear from the face of the globe.</p><div class=\"signed\"><span class=\"persName\"><span style=\"small-caps\">Joseph John Gurney</span></span>.</div></div>", "type" : "literal" }

      { "value" : "<h2><span style=\"small-caps\">a south-african scene</span>.</h2><br /><br />[<span style=\"small-caps\">The</span> result of the war of 1819, between the Colonial Government of the Cape and the Caffer tribes, was the annexation to the Colony of a large tract of the Amakosa country. This was effected by a compulsory convention with the native chiefs, who, with their followers, were dislodged and expelled beyond the Keisi and Chumi rivers. The whole of the evacuated territory, under the appellation of the Neutral Ground, remained unoccupied for several years, and a large portion of it remains so still. I made an excursion through part of it, from the Winterberg mountain down the river Koonap, in 1822, and again in 1825, in another direction. The aspect of the country, though wild, was beautiful and impressive. It was finely diversified with lofty mountains and winding glens, with picturesque rocks and forests, open upland pastures, and level savannahs along the rivers, sprinkled with mimosa trees; and herds of wild animals, quaggas, elands, hartebeests, gnoos, koodoos, with several varieties of the smaller antelopes, were scattered over the verdant pastures; while troops of elephants were browsing undisturbed among the wooded kloofs and jungles of evergreens. But the remains of Caffer hamlets, scattered through every grassy nook and dell, and now long deserted and fast crumbling to decay, excited reflections of no gratifying character, and occasionally increased, even to a painful degree, the feeling of melancholy <em>lonesomeness</em>&nbsp;which a country void of human inhabitants never fails to inspire. Before the Caffers and Ghonaquas were expelled from this territory, a few of them had acquired some knowledge of Christianity, partly from the instructions of that singular but most meritorious man, Doctor Vanderkemp, and more especially from the missionary Williams, who resided about two years among them at the Kat River, previous to his death in 1818. The following Stanzas are an attempt to give a Sketch of a remote Vale in this wild country, after the first missionary station had been left desolate, and previous to its occupation by the Emancipated Hottentots and their Christian Pastors, in 1829. T. P.]<br /><br />I.<br /><span style=\"small-caps\">Far</span> up among the forest-belted mountains,&nbsp;<br />Where Winterberg, stern giant old and grey,<br />Looks down the subject dells, whose gleaming fountains<br />To wizard Kat their virgin tribute pay,&nbsp;<br />A Valley opens to the noontide ray,<br />With green savannahs shelving to the brim&nbsp;<br />Of the young River, sweeping on his way&nbsp;<br />To where Umtoka hies to meet with him,<br />Like a blue serpent gliding through the acacias dim.<br /><br />II.<br />Round this secluded region circling rise<br />A billowy waste of mountains, wild and wide;&nbsp;<br />Upon whose grassy slopes the pilgrim spies&nbsp;<br />The gnu and quagga, by the greenwood side,&nbsp;<br />Tossing their shaggy manes in tameless pride;&nbsp;<br />Or troop of elands near some sedgy fount;<br />Or koodoo fawns, that from the thicket glide&nbsp;<br />To seek their dam beneath the misty mount;<br />With roebucks, harts, gazelles, more than the eye may count.<br /><br />III.<br />And as we journeyed up the pathless glen,&nbsp;<br />Flanked by romantic hills on either hand,<br />The bush-buck oft would bound away -- and then,<br />Beside the willows, backward gazing, stand.&nbsp;<br />And where old forests darken all the land,&nbsp;<br />From rocky Katberg to the river&#39;s brink,&nbsp;<br />The buffalo would start upon the strand<br />Where, &#39;midst palmetto flags, he stooped to drink,<br />And, crashing through the brakes, to the deep jungle shrink.<br /><br />IV.<br />Then, couched at night in hunter&#39;s wattled shieling,<br />How wildly beautiful it was to hear&nbsp;<br />The elephant his shrill <em>reveill\u00e9</em> pealing,<br />Like some far signal-trumpet on the ear:<br />While the broad midnight moon was shining clear,<br />How fearful to look forth upon the woods,&nbsp;<br />And see those stately forest-kings appear,&nbsp;<br />Emerging from their mountain solitudes --<br />As if that trump had woke Earth&#39;s old gigantic broods!<br /><br />V.<br />Such was the fair but melancholy scene<br />Which &#39;midst that lonely wilderness we found,&nbsp;<br />With scarce a trace to tell where man had been,&nbsp;<br />Save the old Caffer cabins crumbling round.<br />Yet this wild glen (Sicana&#39;s ancient ground,)&nbsp;<br />To Nature&#39;s savage tribes abandoned long,&nbsp;<br />Had heard, erewhile, the Gospel&#39;s joyful sound,<br />And low of herds mixed with the Sabbath song.<br />But all is silent now. Th&#39; Oppressor&#39;s hand was strong!<br /><br />VI.<br />Now the gay loxia hangs her pensile nest&nbsp;<br />From the wild-olive, bending o&#39;er the rock,&nbsp;<br />Beneath whose shadow, in grave mantle drest,&nbsp;<br />The meek-eyed Pastor taught his swarthy flock.&nbsp;<br />A roofless ruin, scathed by flame and smoke,&nbsp;<br />Tells where the decent Mission-chapel stood:&nbsp;<br />While the baboon with jabbering cry doth mock&nbsp;<br />The pilgrim, pausing, in his pensive mood,<br />To ask -- &quot;Why is it thus? Shall <span style=\"small-caps\">evil</span> baffle <span style=\"small-caps\">good</span>?&quot;<br /><br />VII.<br />Yes -- for a season Satan may prevail,<br />And hold, as if secure, his dark domain:<br />The prayers of righteous men may seem to fail,<br />And Heaven&#39;s Glad Tidings be proclaimed in vain.<br />But wait in faith: ere long shall spring again&nbsp;<br />The seed that seemed to perish in the ground;&nbsp;<br />And, fertilized by Zion&#39;s latter rain,<br />The long-parched land shall laugh, with harvests crowned,<br />And through those silent wastes Jehovah&#39;s praise resound.<br /><br />VIII.<br />Look round that Vale: behold the unburied bones&nbsp;<br />Of Ghona&#39;s children withering in the blast:&nbsp;<br />Can the sad wind that through the forest moans&nbsp;<br />To these breathe back the spirit that hath passed?&nbsp;<br />So, in the Vale of Desolation vast,<br />In moral death dark Afric&#39;s myriads lie:<br />But the appointed day shall dawn at last,&nbsp;<br />When, breathed on by the Spirit from on High,<br />The dry bones shall awake, and shout -- &quot;Our God is nigh!&quot;<br /><br /><span style=\"small-caps\">Thomas Pringle</span>.", "type" : "literal" }

-- Alas! he knows it not.&nbsp;<br />Heralds of peace had visited that isle,<br />Charged with the news that makes even Slavery smile,<br />But the white rulers held the theme unmeet&nbsp;<br />For Negro-minds, -- too, too divinely sweet!&nbsp;<br />Some had indeed been taught, but not a word&nbsp;<br />Of that inspiring news had William heard,&nbsp;<br />His <em>Christian</em>&nbsp;owner seeing little need<br />To teach the <em>animal</em>&nbsp;so high a creed.<br />Hopeless and blind, he died, and One whose eye&nbsp;<br />No thought escapes, has judged him -- <em>righteously</em>.<br /><br />&nbsp; And this is Slavery! and they are <em>men</em><br />That forge, and fix, and rivet fast the chain,&nbsp;<br />And o&#39;er their brethren hold a tyrant&#39;s sway!&nbsp;<br />Not all a tyrant&#39;s spirit will display;<br />Not all will play the demon, but all <em>may</em>.&nbsp;<br />And that dread power, in hands however just,&nbsp;<br />Is an unwarranted, tremendous trust.<br />Shall a supremacy to man be given&nbsp;<br />Unquestioned, absolute, like that of Heaven?<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; Slavery! of all enormities the worst<br />Man&#39;s fall has gendered, or his madness nurst!&nbsp;<br />Earth teems with crime, and one, above the rest,&nbsp;<br />Against high Heaven uplifts its daring crest;&nbsp;<br />But War, even <em>War</em>, in guilt, in infamy,<br />In hardihood and horror, -- yields to thee!&nbsp;<br />Shame on thy bold pretence, endured so long,&nbsp;<br />Thy <em>right</em>&nbsp;to perpetrate a matchless wrong!<br />Drop thy proud plume, bend low thy hated brow,&nbsp;<br />The eyes of Britons scan the features now.<br />Thy long, dark reign is ending, -- die to be&nbsp;<br />The scorn and wonder of futurity.<br />Time shall be when thy annals shall appear&nbsp;<br />Unnatural fictions to the sickening ear,<br />Though history&#39;s faithful page can ne&#39;er recount&nbsp;<br />Of half thy loathsome crimes the sad amount.&nbsp;<br />Perish! and may kind Heaven a world forgive<br />That suffered thee so many an age to live.<br /><br />C.<br /><br />N---.", "type" : "literal" }
