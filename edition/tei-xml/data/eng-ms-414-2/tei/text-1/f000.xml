            <p>
               Not having heard anything<lb/>
               more respecting the intended Publication I am not<lb/>
               aware whether the design has been abandon'd, or<lb/>
               whether its accomplishment may be so far advanced<lb/>
               as to render the annex'd too late for insertion.<lb/>
               If in time, and worth using, they are heartily<lb/>
               at thy Service. Sorry only, if it could have lent<lb/>
               one somewhat worthier of the acceptance, but if<lb/>
               they serve to show that I wish, well to<lb/>
               the effort, the object they have in view<lb/>
               and end is answered.
            </p>
            <p>
               In the spirit of the<lb/>
               annexed trifle I have endeavor'd briefly,<lb/>
               to express some of those better feelings which<lb/>
               I cannot but think the common character of true Christians &amp; Saints<lb/>
               of whatever name or profession in the unfortunate Slaves, Mother, in reference to<lb/>
               her equally unfortunate Child. But as all believe in Slaves<lb/>
               now, would they were more frequent &amp; in which Humanity,<lb/>
               the latter of Humanities be the consolation of the oppressed<lb/>
               &amp; are forced to Suffer injury &amp; Death Being, I have en-<lb/>
               deavour'd in the second short trifle to embody some of<lb/>
               those humble feelings of a Negro Mother still. I did without<lb/>
               compromise of the principle. Surely the sentiment contained<lb/>
               in the concluding Verse must occur to such as one. For in<lb/>
               my own apprehension as is the Company of Humanity, Sympathy<lb/>
               &amp; the Glory of the Endeavour, the Welfare &amp; the Lot which<lb/>
               he is the highest Victim, implies a thraldom yet not more<lb/> dreadful ––
