               Not having heard anything<lb/>
               more respecting the intended <seg rend="c">Publication</seg> I am not<lb/>
               aware whether the design has been standard, or<lb/>
               whether its accomplishment may be so far advanced<lb/>
               as to render this annex'd too late for insertion.<lb/>
               If in time, and worth using, they are heartily<lb/>
               at thy service. Sorry only, if it could have lent<lb/>
               one somewhat worthier of the acceptance, but if<lb/>
               they serve to show that I wish, well to<lb/>
               the effort, the object thy have in view<lb/>
               and end is answered.

               In the spirit of the<lb/>
               annex'd trifle I have endeavor'd briefly,<lb/>
               to express some of those better feelings which<lb/>
               I conceive constitute the common character of true <seg rend="c">Christians</seg> &amp; <seg rend="c">Saints</seg><lb/>
               of whatever name or profession in the unfortunate <seg rend="c">Slaves</seg>, <seg rend="c">Mother</seg>, in reference to<lb/>
               her equally unfortunate <seg rend="c">Child</seg>. But as all believe in <seg rend="c">Slaves</seg><lb/>
               now, would they were more frequent &amp; in which <seg rend="c">Humanity</seg>,<lb/>
               the <seg rend="c">latter</seg> of <seg rend="c">Humanities</seg> be the consolation of the <seg rend="c">oppressed</seg><lb/>

               deavour'd in the second short trifle to embody some of<lb/>
               those humble <seg rend="c">feelings</seg> of a <seg rend="c">Negro Mother</seg> <seg rend="c">still</seg>. I did without<lb/>

               in the concluding <seg rend="c">Verse</seg> must reach to such as one. For in<lb/>
