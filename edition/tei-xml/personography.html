         to his distaste for mathematics. In 1817 he published anonymously, 'Poems, founded
         upon the Poems of Meleager,' which were re-edited in 1818 under the title of 'Trifles,
         imitative of the Chaster Style of Meleager.' The latter volume was dedicated to Thomas
         Moore, who tells us in his journal that he had the manuscript to look over, and describes
         the poems as 'done with much elegance.' Barnard was presented to the living of Brantingthorp,
         Yorkshire, from which is dated his next publication, 'The Protestant Beadsman' (1822),
         This is described by a writer in 'Notes and Queries' as a 'delightful little volume
         on the saints and martyrs commemorated by the English church, containing biographical
         notices of them, and hymns upon each of them.’ Barnard died prematurely on 10 Jan.
