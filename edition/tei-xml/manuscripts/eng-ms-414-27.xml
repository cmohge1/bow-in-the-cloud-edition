            <salute>My dear Mrs Rawson</salute></opener>
            <p>Your letter did not reach me
            till some time after its date &amp; I was then in
            London considerably occupied by many things which
            hardly left one time to reply to it properly, &amp; beside
            this, as neither my husband nor myself had any
            available manuscripts with us, I could not
            make an answer to you from that plan as
            useful to you as I hoped to do when I returned
            You were quite eight about my having requested
            the two little poems from your hands -- I hoped at
            that time ? to improve them or to substitute
            something much better. &amp; on looking ? ?
            our they seem of so indifferent a stamp that my
            authorly feeling of self-regard outweighs my goal to
            publicly come forward even in so good &amp; noble a
            work as the one you advocate with nothing
            better than the two poor poems I esteem? you, not?
            in truth for their value but because 
            they are your property &amp; not mine.
            </p>
            <p>You are <del>also</del> perhaps aware that the incident
               of the one entitled "The Negro Mother" has
               since mine was written, been made use of by
               "Charlotte Elizabeth" so that the originality of its
               character is gone -- &amp; indeed if I might advise you
               I would recommend <unclear>?</unclear> of those I send being used
               for I doubt extremely their ability to do mon mun
               fill a certain number of pages.</p>
            <p>Had my husband had any idea of you
               continuing your intention of publishing your
               little volume he would not have printed
               the poem you speak of. He would be most
               happy to aid you in your good undertaking
               &amp; so should I most sincerely had we any thing
               by us which we could offer -- or <del>had we</del> <add>were there now</add> time
               before they were wanted -- but our absence from
               home &amp; several things which made an im-
               perative demand both on time &amp; attention
               him out return have rendered it impossible.
               I however copy two stanzas on the other side
               rather? to show his good will than in any hope that
               they will be thought suitable seeing the work
               is edited by a lady.</p>
               <p>I hope it is needless to say how sincere
               a sympathy both my husband &amp; myself felt
               in the <del>head</del> <add>sorrow</add> which removed you from Nottingham
               but time &amp; religion dear friend "being such
               wondrous easing" that this is among the many
               <unclear>mercies [?]</unclear> every tired Christian has to be thank-
               ful for. I have often enquired after your little
               daughter &amp; have been glad to hear that she is
               such a one as to make a mother's heart rejoice.</p>

               with great respect<lb/> yours truly</salute>
