         <p>
            I feel realy ashamed to write to
            you to tell you of my willingness to write a trifle for your
            work after this long delay to do so for it seems to
            contradict the assertion after I have said it yet the
            cause of the delay was my attempting to send something
            with the letter but I have not felt satisfied with what
            I have as yet done &amp;amp; I feel it nesesary for good
            manners sake to write to you without it to tell you
            that I am anxious to do something &amp;amp; most assuredly will
            wether it be good bad or indifferent the attempt will
            be the same -â€“ I am sure Slavery is an abominable
            traffic &amp;amp; a disgrace to Mehomedism or much more
            Christianity &amp;amp; they who sanction it cannot be
            Christians for it is utterly at variance with religion
            &amp;amp; nature -- I should have liked to have had all the
            <pb/>time I can to write a Trifle in as I am very ill at
            a proposed subject &amp; scarcely or ever succeed as I could wish
            will a month or 5 weeks be soon enough I think a
            few verses in the shape of a song on the "Negroe Boy"
            would perhaps do if I can treat the matter as it should
            be at least I will try &amp; if you want it directly I must
            trouble you if you please to write again to tell me so
            if not I shall take my own time as above said I have
            never heard of the Work you mention as I am but
            seldom applied to for such matters in fact I live in such
            an unknown corner of the Country that a letter hardly
            finds out the way to me unless directed as above &amp;
            then there is often some difficulty but I hope this will
            find you to assure you that I am ever anxious to assist
            in every laudable endeavour as far as my humble
            abilitys will permit me &amp; that I am
