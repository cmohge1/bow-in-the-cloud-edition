            Would "Records of Slavery" be a
            suitable title for D. Townley's article?
            The sentence respecting Buxton certainly does
            read awkwardly, but it is constructed lyity
            -- at least according to many indifferent
            precedents. After the word "Senate," you might
            omit the "and," place a semicolon after the
            former word, and read thus "Senate; where
            eventually, his great" &amp;c. Then <hi rend="underlined">remember</hi>
               to strike out a "<hi rend="underlined">eventually</hi>" in the last line
            ??? of the paragraph. -- In the "voice
            from &amp;c" I have ventured to restore the
            verbal reading in the English Version of
            our Saviour's most beautiful and tender
            address, -- which, indeed, is more <hi rend="underlined">im</hi>pressive
               and <hi rend="underlined">ex</hi>pressive too, than the substituted
               form of "<hi rend="underlined">me</hi>, <hi rend="underlined">ye</hi> who are weary," in which "me"
            and "ye," followed by so many vowels, make
            the reader almost whistle in pronouncing
            them. I may probably trouble you to
            enclose a few lines for me to Mr Townley
            but I am so unwell, and so spiritless, that
            <del>that</del>
            I have hardly heart or stength to do anything right.</p>
