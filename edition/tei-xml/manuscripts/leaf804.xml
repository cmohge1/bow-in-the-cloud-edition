            <lb/>could have put a stone into the mo-
            <lb/>moment here erected upon its ruins, to
            <lb/>tell posterity where it stood, the curses it
            <lb/>contained, &amp; how it fell. To many who 
            <lb/>have laboured long &amp; nobly &amp; successfully
            <lb/>in this Cause, the Editor had no means
            <lb/>of access; to others, acknowledgements
            <lb/>are due for the kind interest they have
            <lb/>expressed in the plan and success of
            <lb/>a work which various circumstances
            <lb/>have prevented them from aiding. It is
            <lb/>a subject for thankfulness that so many
            <lb/>have assisted in raising this memorial,
            <lb/>which, though small in its dimensions
            <lb/>&amp; humble in its design, the Compiler
            <lb/>believes will be found a structure <del rend="multi-stroke _ink1" hand="#MAR" change="St1833d" facs="#img_804-0002" >in</del>
            <lb/>of of moral &amp; literary architecture in
            <lb/>some degree worthy of the great occa-
            <lb/>sion 
            <lb/>
            <lb/>There may possibly on some points be
            <lb/>slight differences of opinion between the
            <lb/>various writers in this little volume: it
            <lb/>is therefore desirable to remark that each
            <lb/>contribution is perfectly distinct &amp; inde-
            <lb/>pendent of every other, &amp; each author
            <lb/>responsible only for the piece to which
