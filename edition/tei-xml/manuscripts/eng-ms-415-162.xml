               Feb 25. 1833</dateline>
               <salute>My dear Madam,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>The communication you did me the
               honour to address to me at 18 Aldermanbury <note type="editorial">18 Aldermanbury, London, was the location of Anti-slavery Society offices.</note>
               did not reach me till this morning.
               This delay must be my apology for
               a silence what you perhaps have
               censured, but will now forgive.
               It affords me much pleasure to
               find that you contemplate the pub-
               lication of a volume which I doubt
               not will be highly interesting to every
               sincere <add place="above" rend="caret">^friend</add> of the Abolition of Slavery.
               I much fear whether any thing which
               I can contribute will be worthy a
               place among its pages, but I cannot
               refuse to comply with a request <pb/>
               which will confer upon me so high an
               honour as that of being epocuted with
               the names you have mentioned: I will
               therefore in a few days forward you
               a prose contribution.</p>
               <p>It will afford we much satisfaction
               to aid the circulation of the work
               when published, and if you would allow
               me to offer a suggestion, I would say, the
               sooner it appears the better.</p>
               <p>I feel greatly obliged by your very
               kind invetition to visit Wincobank should
               I again be in the neighbourhood of Sheffield.
               I am sorry the pleasure was precluded
               when last near you.</p>
               <p>I have now been upwards of a fortnight
               in Scotland and have held Six Meetings[?]
               in Glasgow. Three of them were called
               for the purpose of debating hour by hour
               the merits of the question with Borthwick
               the Advocate of the West Indians.
            </p>
            <pb/>
            <p>The last discussion took place last
               Thursday evening when the question was
               decided by a shew of hands. For <hi rend="underlined">gradual
               emancipation</hi> as recommended by the
               [new?] Slavery [party?] about 150 or 200 appeared
               for <hi rend="underlined">Immediate emancipation</hi> as set forth
               by our Society 2400 appeared. This result
               was obtained notwithstanding the most
               strenuous efforts made by the opposite
               party to procure a contrary decision</p>
               <p>With Kindest regards to Mr. &amp; Mrs. Read
               and every other member of your
               much respected family, believe
               me Dear Madam</p>
