            <salute>Dear Madam</salute>
         </opener>
         <p>
            I am almost
            ashamed to address you
            at all after my long
            apparent neglect of
            your kind Favour
            &amp; of the beautiful
            Book you were so <pb/>
            good as to send me
            I need not say I have
            been interested in it
            &amp; admire the Execution
            &amp; putting together of it.
            The only part which
            disgrace it is my 
            Letter &amp; must say <pb/>
            it makes a most 
            contemptible figure 
            among its far superior 
            Neighbours -- I have
            been extremely engaged
            of late on a Subject
            of new Interest -- the
            state of the <hi rend="italic">Natives</hi> <pb/>
            in our Colonies &amp; this
            must be my Excuse
            for my long Silence.
            I send you a Paper
            on the 1st of August
            I cannot refuse
            myself the pleasure
            of telling you though
            a purely private
            Interest, that my <pb/>
            <metamark function="folio-mark">117+</metamark>
            eldest Daughter is to
            be married on that
            Day -- which every
            thing therefore combines
            to render most
            memorable to me --
         </p>
