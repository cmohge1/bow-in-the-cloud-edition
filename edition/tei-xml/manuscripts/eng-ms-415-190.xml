            <salute>My dear Mrs. Rawson,</salute>
         </opener>
         <p>
            I found your Letter, along
            with many others, waiting my
            arrival on my return from
            Scotland (where I have recently
            been in a missionary tour) the
            latter end of last week: &amp;
            my purpose then was to do
            my best to meet the wishes
            it expressed. But on Monday[?]
            last it pleased our Heavenly
            Father to visit us with a
            severe domestic affliction
            at 5 in the morning of that
            day, that fell disease the
            Croup in its severest form,
            seized our youngest Child,
            <pb/> and at noon he died --
            the visitation has fallen
            heavily upon us -- so that
            I have been quite in capacitated
            for any occupation similar
            to that to which your letter
            calls me: &amp; now I find
            myself so oppressed with
            public &amp; pastoral business
            accumulated during my
            late journey &amp; present
            domestic trial, that I
            cannot direct my attention
            to any thing but ^that which is
            worth? keeping? &amp; ?
            in its claims. Indeed I
            <pb/>
            never had any taste or
            tact for that kind of writing
            which your professed &amp; volume
            requires. I have had the
            mis fortune it is true to scribble
            to scribble a few lines of rhyme
            but this has only ?
            when the rhyme came
            I never invited it.
            I never could com:
            mand it -- &amp; might sit the
            whole day in vain endeavours
            to string a few couplets together
            on any subjects that should
            be given to me for this purpose.
            You must therefore place no
            dependence upon me. If,
            contrary to my expectations,
            anything that I may have
            the vanity to think suitable
            should occur, in time, I will
            <pb/>
            send it -- &amp; if not -- I do
            earnestly pray that my
            Sin of omission may not
            be deemed by you unpardon-
            able!
            Mr R. joins me
            in kind regards to yourself
            &amp; worthy family
            and I remain
            my dear Mrs. Rawson</p>
