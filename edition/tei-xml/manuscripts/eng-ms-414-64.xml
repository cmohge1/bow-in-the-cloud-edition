            <salute>My Dear Madam</salute>
         </opener>
         <p>
            Gratified and honoured
            as I must necessarily feel by the
            task you have assigned me I cannot 
            reject that you have left me so little 
            to do. As, however, you are pleased to
            say that the more the corrections
            that are made the better you will
            be pleased, I will venture to suggest
            one or two alterations, which after
            all I am not satisfied will be 
            improvements.
            In the sentence beginning "acknow
            ledgments are also due &amp;c" the words 
            "oppressed" &amp; "expressed" happen to be
            so situated as to occasion a sort
            of jingle in the sound; perhaps the
            former might be changed for ?
            with advantage. In the next
            sentence I fancy that the word
            <pb/>
            "dilapidation" is not used in
            its ordinary acceptation, &amp; it just
            occurred to me that the word
            "bondsmen" is too much associated 
            in our minds with the serfs of
            feudal times to be exactly expressive
            of the peculiar form of West Indian
            Slavery:
