            <salute>My Dear Madam</salute>
         </opener>
         <p>
            Gratified and honoured
            as I must necessarily feel by the
            task you have assigned me I cannot 
            reject that you have left me so little 
            to do. As, however, you are pleased to
            say that the more the corrections
            that are made the better you will
            be pleased, I will venture to suggest
            one or two alterations, which after
            all I am not satisfied will be 
            improvements.</p>
            <p>In the sentence beginning "acknow
            ledgments are also due &amp;c" the words 
            "oppressed" &amp; "expressed" happen to be
            so situated as to occasion a sort
            of jingle in the sound; perhaps the
            former might be changed for ?
            with advantage. In the next
            sentence I fancy that the word
            <pb/>
            "dilapidation" is not used in
            its ordinary acceptation, &amp; it just
            occurred to me that the word
            "bondsmen" is too much associated 
            in our minds with the serfs of
            feudal times to be exactly expressive
            of the peculiar form of West Indian
            Slavery: but of this I cannot sufficiently
            judge. The sentence might admit of
            a change of this kind "It would
            indeed have been delightful if
            <hi rend="italic">every</hi> hand which has taken a
            prominent part [or been actively em-
            ployed] in pulling down the prison
            house, &amp; in striking off the fetters 
            of the bondsmen, could have put &amp;c"</p>
         <p>In speaking of Slavery in America
         you say that "two millions of wretched 
         slaves groan beneath <hi rend="italic">the lash of 
         the oppressor</hi>." There is nothing in the
            last expression that I think either in-
            applicable or too severe; but as the
            <hi rend="double-underline">lash</hi> is more especially &amp; more cruelly
            employed in the West Indies than in <pb/>
