            <salute>My Dear Madam</salute>
         </opener>
         <p>
            Gratified and honoured
            as I must necessarily feel by the
            task you have assigned me I cannot 
            reject that you have left me so little 
            to do. As, however, you are pleased to
            say that the more the corrections
            that are made the better you will
            be pleased, I will venture to suggest
            one or two alterations, which after
            all I am not satisfied will be 
            improvements.</p>
            <p>In the sentence beginning "acknow
            ledgments are also due &amp;c" the words 
            "oppressed" &amp; "expressed" happen to be
            so situated as to occasion a sort
            of jingle in the sound; perhaps the
            former might be changed for ?
            with advantage. In the next
            sentence I fancy that the word
            <pb/>
            "dilapidation" is not used in
            its ordinary acceptation, &amp; it just
            occurred to me that the word
            "bondsmen" is too much associated 
            in our minds with the serfs of
            feudal times to be exactly expressive
            of the peculiar form of West Indian
            Slavery: but of this I cannot sufficiently
            judge. The sentence might admit of
            a change of this kind "It would
            indeed have been delightful if
            <hi rend="italic">every</hi> hand which has taken a
            prominent part [or been actively em-
            ployed] in pulling down the prison
            house, &amp; in striking off the fetters 
            of the bondsmen, could have put &amp;c"</p>
         <p>In speaking of Slavery in America
         you say that "two millions of wretched 
         slaves groan beneath <hi rend="italic">the lash of 
         the oppressor</hi>." There is nothing in the
            last expression that I think either in-
            applicable or too severe; but as the
            <hi rend="double-underline">lash</hi> is more especially &amp; more cruelly
            employed in the West Indies than in <pb/>
            America, while there are other &amp;
            perhaps more degrading evils con-
            nected with it in the latter place,
            you will pardon me for being so
            hyper-critical as suggesting whether
            you could approve of the substitution
            of a clause instead of "groan beneath
            the lash of the oppressor." It might
            be –– "the doomed to suffer its <hi rend="superscript">X</hi> brand &amp;
            its curse" –– or something to that effect.</p>
         <p>I am really ashamed to make
            these observations as the exceptions are
            so trifling &amp; even questionable. There is one
            sentence which you have left unfinished,
            but I have not presumed to add anything.
            The Preface appears to me just what the
            case required, &amp; if you had not made
            it a sort of duty to me to look out for
            something to correct, I should not have
            found anything that in my view would
            have called for alteration. The lines of
            Montgomery are very beautiful &amp;
            appropriate. Would you have the
            sentence placed above the two
            passages of Scripture in the same
            position which is now occupies? <pb/>
            I am glad to hear that your dear
            little girl is better, &amp; hope that 
            with a change of weather the very
            many persons who are now suffering
            under a sort of influenza will be
            speedily recovered.</p> <closer>Believe me 
            to be, My Dear Madam,
            <salute>Yours very faithfully</salute>
