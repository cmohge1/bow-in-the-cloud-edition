After adopting and discarding various topics, as <br />connected with the general question, the simple form of expression <br />which heads the following stanzas, occurred to me, and was the <br />germ from which every other thought proceeded. I could view <br />Slavery in no other light than that of one continued system <br />of oppression and terror, and therefore, have considered it in its <br />effects, as operating both on matter and mind - on man, in his <br />health and spirits - on man, as amenable to the civil law, and <br />as a professing christian - operating on every relation of life, whether <br />civil, domestic, or religious -- and its, tremendous results, in reference <br />to the just judgments of a sin-avenging God. In order to produce effect, <br />I have aimed more at strength than ease; and if I shall <br />have produced anything capable of imparting either satisfaction <br />to yourself or aid to the cause, it will be sufficient for me <br />to know, with the female in the gospel, that though I have <br />not done what I would, I have done what I could and <br />that little has been accepted. With christian regards to the <br />family,</p><div class="closer">I am <br />With the utmost Respect <br />Your Obedt Servant <div class="signed">James Everett <br />Manchester. <br />June 14th

for terror here</div><div class="l">resurps an universal reign.</div><div class="l">Away, like righteous Lot, in fear</div><div class="l">Nor tarry those in all the plain.</div><div class="l">Away, for through the Western Isles</div><div class="l">Which sprang from occan's bed in smiles</div><div class="l">damon stalks, and claims the whole</div><div class="l">Like him who once to Edon stoll</div><div class="l">And spread the blight of death.</div><div class="l">His music is the victim's cry,</div><div class="l">The shrivelling glance is in his eye,</div><div class="l">Infection in his breath.</div></div><div class="lg"><div class="l">Talk not of joy, where slavery reigns.</div><div class="l">Of brightning hopes midst "hope deferr'd,</div><div class="l">The negro's joys are huny in chains</div><div class="l">The negro's hopes are all interrd:</div><div class="l">He sees the writing on the wall</div><div class="l">In laws, enacted to enthral</div><div class="l">And seems, in every drivers hand</div><div class="l">To see, upon the desert sand</div><div class="l">The lion's fatal pan</div><div class="l">And in the voice of men of blood</div><div class="l">To hear the voice that shakes the wood,</div><div class="l">And holds the soul in awe</div></div><div class="lg"><div class="l">Foul Misery, like a blast from hell,</div><div class="l">Hath forced throughout the soul its way</div><div class="l">As mighty tempests when they swell</div><div class="l">And toss on high the ocean spray</div><div class="l">And every flood in maniac form</div><div class="l">Becomes the plaything of the storm</div><div class="l">Still driving onward, still the tide</div><div class="l">Hath burst the vessels rampart side</div><div class="l">Through which the torrents pour --</div><div class="l">And pour like cataracts from the rocks</div><div class="l">Tremendous as the earthquake's shocks,</div><div class="l">While all her dungeons roar</div></div><div class="lg"><div class="l">The face which once was full and round</div><div class="l">Where health sat smiling through the jet,</div><div class="l">And eyes, still more expressive found</div><div class="l">Are sunk, like suns, untimely set.</div><div class="l">But deeper shadows than the skin</div><div class="l">Like musts, from troubled thoughts within</div><div class="l">Arise, to dim the joyous sight,</div><div class="l">And fret away the frame of might,</div><div class="l">without the power to flee</div><div class="l">Those shadows -- sudden as a squall --</div><div class="l">Flit o'er the face, and darken all</div><div class="l">Like winds across the sea.</div></div><div class="lg"><div class="l">Lo, in the precincts of the court</div><div class="l">where Justice only should

class="l">In lifeless silence still he stands</div><div class="l">His inward spirit shrieks unheard,</div><div class="l">And needed like the wailing bird,</div><div class="l">Upon some lonely tower</div><div class="l">While Terror, from his lurid seat,</div><div class="l">And withering as the lightnings heat,</div><div class="l">Descends supreme in power</div></div><div class="lg"><div class="l">To slaves -- except the christian few</div><div class="l">The Sabbath's holy calm is lost</div><div class="l">And these, their weekly toil pursue</div><div class="l">With minds, by human tempests tost.</div><div class="l">Their boding thoughts, from various ills,</div><div class="l">Like floods amidst the wildest hills</div><div class="l">Which rage throughout the lengthen'd night.</div><div class="l">Rush headlong from their fearful height,</div><div class="l">and seek the stream that flows;</div><div class="l">For, stooping from its dreary place,</div><div class="l">The mind sweeps trough the means of grace,</div><div class="l">Till fury finds repose</div></div><div class="lg"><div class="l">But oft, ere that repose is found</div><div class="l">The men of Belial crowd the road</div><div class="l">And dare to visit holy ground,</div><div class="l">And stand among the sons of God:</div><div class="l">Where damon art the balance holds</div><div class="l">To weigh the truth the priest unfolds,</div><div class="l">or basely -- and by civil test</div><div class="l">Confound the freedom of the blest,</div><div class="l">With freedom to the slave</div><div class="l">And boldly charge that priest to flee,</div><div class="l">Or try, with cruel mockery,</div><div class="l">And doom him to the grave</div></div><div class="lg"><div class="l">The negro, branded at the mart</div><div class="l">Pours forth in vain the rending sigh</div><div class="l">A single bid will quail his heart,</div><div class="l">And sever each domestic tie:</div><div class="l">And where soe'er his feet ^shall roam,</div><div class="l">His manhood ne'er will know a home!</div><div class="l">No wife to sooth or raise his head.</div><div class="l">No infant babes to cheer his shed</div><div class="l">Or fan affections flame</div><div class="l">His grave is distant and alone</div><div class="l">The spot to wife and babes unknown,</div><div class="l">-- No tablet for his name!</div></div><div class="lg"><div class="l">Not one of all the infant throng</div><div class="l">That lies upon a mother's knee,</div><div class="l">But gives to agony -- a tongue,</div><div class="l">Unknown to children of the free,</div><div class="l">Unknown to those, whose tears but flow</div><div class="l">From transient fits of tiny woe,</div><div class="l">And who, like troubled sea birds, cry</div><div class="l">While passing through the stormy sky,</div><div class="l">And then -- upon the wave --</div><div class="l">As softly fall as gleams of light,</div><div class="l">And float in beauty to the sight,</div><div class="l">All fearless of a grave.</div></div><div class="lg"><div class="l">Ah, no! to babes in slavery born,</div><div class="l">Few are the seas and skies serene,</div><div class="l">All ruthless, from a mother torn,</div><div class="l">Her weeping image still is seen;</div><div class="l">Nor less her voice they seem to hear</div><div class="l">In lingering tones on Memory's ear</div><div class="l">Now echoing sweet -- now wildly roll</div><div class="l">Through all the regions of the soul,</div><div class="l">-- Then, soft -- and far away --</div><div class="l">Like music on the midnight lake</div><div class="l">Till, starting from the dream, they wake</div><div class="l">To misery, a prey</div></div><div class="lg"><div class="l">Nor say, the mother cannot feel</div><div class="l">At whom the poisoned dart is flung;--</div><div class="l">The body owns the quivering steel</div><div class="l">The tortured wild-cat loves her young:</div><div class="l">And can she from her babes depart,</div><div class="l">Whose life-strings twine around her heart, --</div><div class="l">Those babes, whom nature e'er must own</div><div class="l">As flesh of flesh and bone of bone,</div><div class="l">And part without a pang?</div><div class="l">O, no; -- employ the scourge, the knife,</div><div class="l">And tear the limbs and threaten life,</div><div class="l">On these she still must hang.</div></div><div class="lg"><div class="l">Away, away, for terror here</div><div class="l">Usurps an universal reign,</div><div class="l">Where parents, children, live in fear</div><div class="l">And walk upon their kindred slain.</div><div class="l">Away, -- for now those beauteous Isles,</div><div class="l">With breath of balm and face of smiles,</div><div class="l">-- which yet had man's Elysium been,</div><div class="l">Had man himself not changed the scene,</div><div class="l">Are threatened from above;</div><div class="l">And judgment, though it linger long,</div><div class="l">Will burst in wrath for Afric's wrong,</div><div class="l">And now begins to move.</div></div><div class="lg"><div class="l">Away, -- for men of blood have piled</div><div class="l">The fabric of their guilt so high</div><div class="l">That dark, o'er Isles, which e'er had smiled,</div><div class="l">It spreads its shadow to the eye.</div><div class="l">Away, -- for Vengeance springs to birth,</div><div class="l">And with the whirlwind sweeps the earth,</div><div class="l">And bears, like autumn leaves away</div><div class="l">The men of guilt, whose iron sway</div><div class="l">Held innocence in chains.</div><div class="l">Away, -- for down the fabric falls</div><div class="l">The voice of blood for justice calls,</div><div class="l">And God in Vengeance reigns.</div></div><div class="signed">James Everett. <br /><span class="placeName">Manchester</span> <br
