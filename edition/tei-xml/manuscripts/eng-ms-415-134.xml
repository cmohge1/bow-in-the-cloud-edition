            He hath sent me to heal the broken hearted
            to preach deliverance to the Captives -- &amp; recovering of light
            to the blind to set at liberty them that bruised
            to preach the acceptable year of the Lord -- Luke 4th chapter
            18 &amp; 19th verses
            Lest! to that deep despairing groan, that frantic cry of woe!
            Gaze on those looks of agony, those scalding tears that flow
            flash! 'tis the clank of Slav'ry's chain, they forge each ? fast
            One parting, hopeless look of love -- Ah! Captive, 'tis thy last!!
            Now swiftly o'er the briny deep the fatal vessel flies,
            No light of day, no breath of Heav'n, to mingle with their sighs
            Unheeded flow those bitter tears, e'en Pity[?] weeps in vain
            Alas! the depth of human woe -- they ne er will smile again!
            Thro' years of piercing agony, we hear the sad low moan
            or cutting last, or cruel scourge extoot? the deeper groan
            Then mem'ry pictures home, &amp; wife. Ah! can he e'er forget?
            His children too, can they be slaves? More bitter anguish yet? <pb/>
            Towards Heav'n the clasped hands are raised the woe[?] worn ? eye
            God pity Thee!! poor suff'ring one! from Man no aid is nigh
            Yet cheer, oh cheer thee hapless Slave -- thy Tyrants ? is o'er
            Thou'st hast'ning to that happy Land, where He can set[?] no more
            Th' indignant heart has burst in twain -- its last warm streaming-
            blood
            Appeals from mans base treachery -- to a heart searching[?] God!
            Thou Lord! hast heard the Captives prayers, hast set his Spirit
            free
            Captive, but in the bonds of love, he dwells in bliss with thee!!
            How rouse[?] thee Albions! ah how long has been thy dreamy
            sleep --
            Shall Africs children still be Slaves "still drag those chains
            &amp; weep."
            Britons!! oh Liberty is yours oh Liberty you prize --
            Then claim it, for you fetterd Slave, who now in anguish
            lies --
            A Light, the star of Hope &amp; Joy, has o'er th' Atlantic shone
            Shall it be quench'd in deeper night -- shall Hope's bright
            gleam be gone?
            Ah! no! let ev'ry heart respond -- be firm, press on &amp; prove
            What British hands &amp; hearts can do, when sway'd by
            Christian love!!
            Elizabeth
            she hath done what she could! <!-- allusion to Mark 14:8 -->
