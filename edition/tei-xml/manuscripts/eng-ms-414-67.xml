            <salute>My Dear Madam</salute>
         </opener>
         <p>
            I am much obliged
            for the sight of the proof-
            sheet, &amp; think with you
            that the Title of the verses
            would hardly be complete
            without the addition you
            mention. I know of nothing
            better than what you have
            expressed -- "The Aged Slave
            on finding that the period
            fixed for <hi rend="italic">complete</hi> eman-
            cipation was too distant
            for him to expect to live
            to participate in its benefits."
            As to the transposition <pb/>
            of the words "son" &amp; "child"?
            if you think it would be
            better to make the alteration
            I shall feel certain that it
            will be an improvement.
            I am persuaded that in
            reading verses if on first
            looking at them anything
            appears uncouth, misplaced,
            or awkward, it ought to be
            at once condemned or corrected,
            for we may read the same
            words ever so often as not
            to perceive the faults which
            were glaring at first sight.
            I have read over the whole
            of the sheet, &amp; see nothing
            to correct unless, in the
            last line but one of <pb/>
            page 289, the word <hi rend="italic">not</hi>
            should be placed before the
            word cheaply. In <hi rend="italic">one
            slave</hi> the triumph of the
            the cause was indeed
            achieved cheaply at the
            cost of Â£20 000 000 &amp; it
            may be that Mr Ely refers
            to that: but when I finish
            read it I thought it possible
            another <del>sense[?]</del> meaning
            might have been intended.
            I have been frightened by
            the weather from setting
            off to-day, &amp; therefore shall
            not now leave until Satur-
            day. I am sorry on account
            of your Packet, but I had
            fixed not to go if the weather
            precluded the possibility <pb/>
            of deriving much advantage
            from the journey. As it is
            I shall be in Nottingham
            on Monday.

            Yours very faithfully</salute>
