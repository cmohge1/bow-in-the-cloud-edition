            <salute>My dear Madam,</salute>
         </opener>
         <p>Having, contrary to my
            intention, omitted sending on immediate
            acknowledgment of your polite and kind
            note, I must beg you to accept with
            my best thanks for its friendly contents,
            my apologies for having thus delayed
            them. It would affaid me much pleasure
            to enjoy a few hours of your society, and
            I am not without hope of accomplishing
            this purpose at some interval, before
            my return.</p>
            <p>A copy of your elegant volume
            was sent into my hands by Mr. Conder
            the evening before I left home.
            In the praspect of paiting, from my
            family. I had not much leisure of
            mind<pb/>
            mind, to consider its merits. Therefore,
            contented myself with ascertaining satis-
            factorily the two points on which, I believe,
            all writers -- whether drinking at the
            fountain head of Coustaly[?], or sipping at its
            remotest confluence with the waters
            of oblivion -- will he found most sen-
            sitive: -- What mistakes have the
            printers made? and who are our companions?
            Both questions were imeceptionable[?]
            answered both for Mr. Conder's verses and
            my own. Then, I felt obliged to close
            the book, and can guess[?] at its further
            character only only as it may be more
            or less favourably received in the review.
            The Critic seems to have possessed the
            good taste and tact to transmute
            the <hi rend="italic">one</hi> disadvantage -- its late appear-
            ance into a recommendation.
            I cannot suppress a degree of agitation
            in looking on the thickening shadows
            of this evening, and thinking of
            tomorrow dawn. -- feelings in which
            you have feared, that you most
            (deeply<pb/>
            deeply participate[?].. A day so full of
            thrilling interest may not again wake
            until the last sunrise shall appear.
            I must offer my sincere thanks for
            your very kind enquiries, and am thankful
            to be able to say All is well.</p>
            <p>My Sister unites with me
            affectionate respects to Mrs. Reid[sic], and
            best regards to your whole family. She
            begs also her kindest remembrance
            to yourself. Believe me,
            My dear Mrs Rawson</p>
