            Dear Miss Rawson</opener>
         <p>
            I ought before to have thanked you
            for your very pretty little volume. I [?]
            the poor part I took in its production had
            flitted away from my mind and memory
            but it is very delightful to find that
            minds and memories better than mine
            have been occupied with topics which (to
            my shame be it spoken) I had almost forgotten
            the topics? -- No[?] -- but my small participation
            in labours so generous? devoted and useful
            as yours.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Bowring is engaged in the most pain-
            ful and percmptory of duties -- She is closing
            the eyes of her dying mother -- otherwise I am
            sure she would have charged me with a
            mission of kind remembrances
            </p>
         <closer>
         <salute>Most faithfully and ever yours</salute>
         <signed>John Bowring</signed>
         </closer>
