         <p>
            It was most fully my
            intention to reply to your last letter
            by return of post. The difficulty,
            however, which I felt in returning
            any thing like a satisfactory answer,
            induced delay in the first instance;
            and in the interim, my thoughts and
            feelings have been much absorbed;
            our youngest boy having been confined
            with measles, from which he has
            most mercifully recovered; and the last
            few days having been unexpectedly
            passed away from home. Still the
            uneasy thought has continually recurred,
            that your letter remained unacknowledged.
            I found that Mr. Conder considered it
            no easier task than I myself did, to
            decide on a title, and although I felt
            certain<pb/>
            certain that Montgomery's West Indies
            would supply more than one suitable
            motto[?], I was yet unable to select two
            lines, which might be so detached.
            It would not have seemed kind to say
            in reply to such a letter as yours: who[?] could
            counsel and decide half so well as
            Montgomery himself? although I [?]
            much that you should think of
            consulting any one else. Thus have I
            vainly cogitated, under the painful sense
            of keeping you in daily expectation
            and the perpetually recurring[?] fear of not
            being, at last, able to resolve that
            expectation. Having just had another
            conversation with Mr Conder, I am
            not without hope that he may
            be able to suggest something on which
            you may decide. I shall therefore leave
            the remaining page for him to fill more
            worthily, after entreating your pardon for
            this long delay, and answering you that
            it has caused me much regret.
            I beg to be remembered[?] with affectionate respect[?]
            to Mr &amp; Mrs Read, and love to your Sister.
            May I be allowed also, to [?] a kiss for your
            dear little Daughter.</p>

            <p>
               I really feel, as Mrs Conder
               has stated, quite at a loss what title to
               suggest; but incline to think that "Eleutheria,
               or the Negro's Memorial" would be the best of
               those you have mentioned. I wish that my inven
               tion would supply a better. Those who would not
               understand the Greek word (which is one that
               occurs in the Greek Testt. repeatedly) would at
               least understand the second title; &amp; the two
               together would imply both a retrospective &amp; a
               prospective view of the subject. I regret that
               the volume was not brought out last spring, when
               the public feeling was all alive to the subject;
               but under existing circumstances, I hope that
               the notes of hope &amp; joy will be found pleasingly
               blended with the sadder straws, so as to give
               to the publication a chain &amp; interest which
            it could not have had before the legislative abo-
            lition of Slavery. I hope that Montgomery has sounded
            the trump of jubilee. I seem myself to have almost lost
            the power of writing poetry, except at rare intervals, &amp;
            feel ashamed of my meagre contribution.
            I suppose that you have seen a certain pamphlet
            called Wages or the Whip. Could I send you a copy
            free of expense, if you have it not? I beg to join
            with Mrs Conder in kindest respects to Mr &amp; Mrs Read
            &amp; the rest of your circle. I am, my dear Madam,
            </p>
