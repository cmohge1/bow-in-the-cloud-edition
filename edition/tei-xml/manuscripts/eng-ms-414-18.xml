            <salute>My dear Mrs. Rawsan,</salute>
         </opener>
         <p>
            It was most fully my
            intention to reply to your last letter
            by return of post. The difficulty,
            however, which I felt in returning
            any thing like a satisfactory answer,
            induced delay in the first instance;
            and in the interim, my thoughts and
            feelings have been much absorbed;
            our youngest boy having been confined
            with measles, from which he has
            most mercifully recovered; and the last
            few days having been unexpectedly
            passed away from home. Still the
            uneasy thought has cantinually recurred,
            that your letter remained unacknowleged.
            I found that Mr. Conder considered it
            no easier task than I myself did, to
            decide on a title, and although I felt
            certain<pb/>
            certain that Montgomery's West Indies
            would supply more than one suitable
            motto[?], I was yet unable to select two
            lines, which might be so detached.
            It would not have seemed kind to say
            in reply to such a letter as yours: who[?] could
            counsel and decide half so well as
            Montgomery himself? although I mamelle
            much that you should think of
            consulting any one else. Thus have I
            vainly cogitated, under the painful sense
            of keeping you in daily expectation
            and the perpetually recurring[?] fear of not
            being, at last, able to resolve that
            expectation. Having just had another
            conversation with Mr Conder, I am
            not without hope that he may
            be able to suggest something on which
            you may decide. I shall therefore leave
            the remaining page for him to fill more
            worthily, after entreating your pardon for
            this long delay, and answering you that
            it has caused me much regret.
            I beg to be remembered[?] with affectionate respect[?]
            to Mr &amp; Mrs Read, and love to your Sister.
            May I be allowed also, to [?] a kiss for your
            dear little Daughter.</p>

               Yours sincerely and affectionately
