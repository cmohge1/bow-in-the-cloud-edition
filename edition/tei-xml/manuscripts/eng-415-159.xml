            <salute>My dear Sir,</salute></opener>
         <p>
            I should be most
            truly glad to comply with
            any request of yours. But
            I really am so much occupied,
            or rather overwhelmed by
            business of different kinds
            that it will, I fear, be quite
            out of my power to
            write any thing you your 
            <pb/>
            friend's collection. I have
            no fragment by me which
            would be of the least use
            to her.
         </p>
         <p>
            I am truly glad to hear that
            your cough has departed
            and that you have
            had so long and so quiet a
            holiday. What do you
            think of Sir Andrew Agnew's
            Lord's Day Bill?<note type="editorial">The Lord's Day Bill...</note> And <pb/>
            what does Mrs Rawson think
            of it? We had an argument
            on the subject, I remember,
            at Hanover Square. I am
            favorable to temperate legislation
            on the subject. But this
            measure seems to have
            been framed by persons very
            much of the temper of
            those who forbade the
            disciples to rub the <pb/>
            ears of corn in their
            hands.<note type="editorial">Allusion to Luke 6.1: 'And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first, that he went through the corn fields; and his disciples plucked the ears of corn, and did eat, rubbing them in their hands.'</note>
         </p>
         <p>
            Remember me kindly to all
            your family, and believe
            me <unclear>?</unclear>,</p>
