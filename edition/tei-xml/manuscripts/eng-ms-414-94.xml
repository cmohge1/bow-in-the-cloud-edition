            <salute>My very dear friend,</salute>
         </opener>
         <p>
            I am obliged, greatly
            obliged, by your welcome note &amp; welcome
            book; which indeed, come into my
            hand but yesterday, which I trust
            you will accept as the explanation of
            my great delay in acknowledging them.
            The book is exceedingly neat &amp; has no fault
            but the one you name, its bulkiness. Nei-
            ther the eye nor the hand quite agree to the
            size; but you would naturally feel de-
            licate in withholding, or abridging the con-
            tributions you had yourself procured, es-
            pecially from quarters so valued as those <pb/>
            from which the principal articles are proceed-
            ed. You will not feel disappointed, I am
            sure, at some slight pecuniary sacrifice.
            The public, even the religious portion of it,
            are not quite so liberal or even just
            to such designs as yours, as we might
            anticipate. I think you might with the
            utmost propriety have omitted to convey
            a copy to the minor contributors such as
            myself. In this you have been too liberal.
            Your benevolent purpose must compensate
            the toil &amp; the loss. When we read your vol-
            ume we shall all [???] &amp; think of our dear
            friend, who, after all her troubles, modestly
            styled herself the 'Compiler'.
            After long wonderings, we are now
            finding a resting place at least for a short
            time. We have this day enjoyed apart-
            ments in Camberwell. Here we hope to a-<pb/>
            bide for a season, how long, is known
            to Him who fixes the bounds ^of our habita-
            tion! Mrs Carey feels truly obliged by
            your kind overture to her, &amp; designs
            to give expression to her own feelings in
            a few separate lines to your dear Ma[???]
            Our beloved Anne is fast improving.
            She has been upon the very verge of the
            grave. But God has been merciful to
            her &amp; to me. She har a sweet parent in
            Mrs Carey. I think she will send
            a line to her beloved friend, Elizabeth. <!-- MAR's daughter -->
            Our united[?] love to her &amp; a kiss. Allow
            me to beg my affectionate respects to every
            one within your endeared circle, &amp; to sub-
            scribe myself,
         </p>
