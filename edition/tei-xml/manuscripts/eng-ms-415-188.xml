            <salute>My dear Miss Read</salute></opener>
         <p>
            I cannot express to you how
            much pain I feel in the long delay
            which has attended the acknowledgement
            of your most interesting letter of
            the March last. Not a day has
            passed, I can truly assure you...
            without serious?, &amp; I may say, anxious
            thoughts respecting the important
            subject to which it refers - and
            delayed from day to day to
            write in the hope that tomorrow, and
            tomorrow, would yield me the leisure
            and what was still more to the
            purpose, the cue, for the trifling
            service you was so good as to seek
            at my hands -- but no such tomorrow
            has yet arrived. I have tried
            but I can accomplish nothing
            I did indeed once string couplets
            and do now &amp; then put a few rhymes
            together still but then, I have
            never sought them -- they have
            come unasked, and unexpected
            &amp; now that I [deleted word]? have earnestly
            desired them -â€“ they refuse to obey
            my call -- &amp; every effort has
            utterly failed. And this is the state
            of mind in reference to your request
            in which I have been for the
            last two months -- Ashamed of my
            delay -- yet reluitant to write to
            tell you, what I have been
            compelled to disclose after all
            &amp; what, it I had told sooner, I
            should have communicated, though
            not with less regret, yet certainly
            with an easier conscience
            the same circumstances which
            have caused the delay in this com-
            munication to you, have also oper-
            ated to keep me from Mr Roscoe, as
            least in a great degree -- though
            till lately the pressure of business
            when him, relating to the subject
            of slavery which has of recently
            been much agaitated here, to get
            with a consideration of
            his infirmities &amp; [?]
            indisposition, has induced
            him to regard an application to
            him as unsuitable. I But
            independently of these things, I
            could not but think I should go
            to him with a poor[?] face, to ask[?]
            his help when as yet I had done
            nothing my self. I will however,
            apply to him, now -- And if he
            should comply, and it should
            unhappily be too late, his verses
            may adorn a second edition of your
            work.
            <pb/>
            And now, my dear friend, can you
            forgive me. I have no alternative
            but to call[?] my self upon your kindness
            I have told you honestly the truth how-
            ever much you may be disposed, to
            censure me, exonerate me &amp; entreat[?}
            you[?] from the charge of wilful neglect
            or indifference -- the subject is one
            in which, I, in common with every man
            worthy of the name of man, must be
            deeply interested -- and if I could write
            about it as I feel, you wd. have [?]
            that breathe towards that [?]. Mrs. R
            am sorry to say is very delicate still in
            her health -- I am this day setting off
            <pb/> <!-- crosswritten on the opening page -->
            for London -- &amp; thence to H[?]. </p><closer>With kindest
            and most respectful regards to your most excellent
            family, in which
            Mrs. R. unites, I
            am most truly
            <salute>Yr. obliged friend</salute>
