         <p>
            I received with much pleasure
            your letter this month and hasten[?] to reply.
            The appropriation[?] of the 50 pounds so kindly
            given by the friends to whom you refer
            shall be after left to their [?] after
            you have stated to them my proposal
            I shall feel a pleasure in call g it by the
            name of [?] Thompson, and I have
            already engaged a young lady to take
            charge of the School[?], hoping that should
            I not be permitted to appropriate this
            Sum, I shall not fail of assurance in a
            cause in which the future welfare
            both of Jamaica and of Africa
            are so nearly associated <pb/>
            as I hope to have the pleasure of
            [?] intercourse[?] with the kind
            donors ere[?] I leave for Jamaica I shall
            not now[?] enter[?] more fully into
            particulars. With the assurance[?]
            I could obtain from Jamaica I
            would[?] [?] to conduct[?] such a School[?]
            as I desire to see established, including
            the maintenance of a few rescued
            Aficans for 100 pounds per annum
            and without any maintenance
            for 40
         </p>

            <salute>With much respect<lb/>
            I am<lb/>
            Yours very affy</salute>
