         <p>Remarks on the Christian duty of putting an
            and to slavery by Joseph John Gurney
            Sanganton that for
            That it is our bounden duty as Christians to
            labour in the cause of the abolition of slavery, is a proposition
            so reasonable &amp; obvious, that one might have supposed, no one
            could have doubted its it. Yet such is the perversion of heart
            &amp; intellect to which were all be mankind are liable, that
            sane persons have contrived to persuade thamselves, that
            their Christion duty, in reference to this subject, lies
            absolute inaction.
            In the first place, they urge as a plea
            for their non-interference, the curse promounced by Noah
            on Canaan "Cursed be Canaan", said the offended Patriarch?
            a servant of servants shall he be to his brethren? Gen. IX. 20
            Since the person by whom Noah had been offended
            was not Canaan, but his father Ham, its it is taken for
            granted by these objectors that "Canaan", is here put for "Ham".
            And since Ham, through his eldest son Mizraim, was the
            Progenitor of the Africans, it is concluded they conclude by them, first
            That the prophecy is accomplished in the slavery of the Negroes,
            &amp; secondly, that therefore in laboring for the emancipation of
            the Negroes, we labor against the declared decree of the
            Lord of all the earth.
            Now supposing this interpretation application of the
            prophecy to be correct the African race to be the true one,
            what can be more absurd than such a practical inference?
            The duration of Canaanâ€™s servitude, is a subject on which
            does it contain
            the prophecy says nothing; much less is there the slightest
            intimation, that their cruel bondage was to have no end.
            Who then shall say, that the time is not come for its the
            of African slavery
            extermination. O who can deem it unreasonable to suppose
            that in effecting this object, God may be pleased to
            make use of human instrumentality.
            But I can by no means assent to such an
            interpretation of the prophetic record; &amp; which I believe
            received its accomplished accomplishment when the Canaanites
            who were left in the land of Palestine, became hewers of wood</p>
