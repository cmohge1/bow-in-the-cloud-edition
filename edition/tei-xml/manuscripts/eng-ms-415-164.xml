            <salute>Madam --</salute></opener>
         <p>I am grieved
            and ashamed to find that
            I have so long delayed to reply
            to the letter with which you
            honoured me some weeks
            ago. The pressure of many
            engagements, <hi rend="underlined">merely</hi>, would not
            have occasioned this delay
            but I have really felt reluctant
            to confess myself unable to <pb/>
            take part in promoting your
            benevolent design -- and yet
            at last I must make this con-
            fession -- Poetry and fiction
            are quite beyond my sphere
            nor can I imagine that any such
            essay as it would be possible for
            me to furnish -- however well
            intended it might be, would
            either suit the company in
            which it must appear or at all
            subserve the great cause you
            propose to advocate.
            It remains <add rend="caret" place="above">^for me</add> therefore only
            <pb/>
            to offer my sincere and hearty
            wishes for the success of your
            humane and christian-like
            endeavours and, though
            unknown, to <unclear>?</unclear> myself
            with sympathy and respect
         </p>
