This is one reason  <br />why I did not notice your letter sooner; and another is that  <br />having unhappily Cataracts on both my eyes I have not been  <br />able to see either to read or to write for some time, and this  <br />circumstance makes me aoord correspondence as mach as possible  <br />With respect to the publication of your volume of Poems, no person  <br />wishes it more success than I do, because no person can feel  <br />himself more interested in the cause, which it is intended to  <br />promote; indeed, I think that a work of this description may  <br />secure the attention of some, whom prose-compositions would not  <br />so much lay hold of &amp; thus a greater number of persons may  <br />become acquainted with the case of the unhappy people whose  <br />rights we advocate. I am sorry that I am so situated as  <br />not to be able to contribute some little morceau towards  <br />your Book. But these little things are so foreign to my  <br />habits of composition, that I know I should not be able to  <br />satisfy myself &amp; therefore must by you to excuse me.</p><p>I am obliged to you for your wish that I may live[?]  <br />to record the total abolition of Slavery. This would be most  <br />delighlfull, but I have no expectation of it. I may, however  <br />probably live to see the monster Slavery receive its death  <br />wound from the British Parliament. This will satisfy me  <br />and I shall be most truly &amp; reverently thankful for it--</p><div class="closer">I am Madam yours very truly  <div class="signed">Thomas Clarkson</div></div></div><!--TEI back--><div class="stdfooter autogenerated"><div class="footer"><!--standard links to project, institution etc--><a class="plain" href="/">Home</a> </div><address>Thomas Clarkson.
