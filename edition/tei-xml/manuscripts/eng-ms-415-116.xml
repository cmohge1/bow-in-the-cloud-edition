         <salute>Dear Madam</salute></opener>
         <p>
            Your letter followed me in an
            absence from home which had delayed
            my answering it until now. I hope
            therefore you have proceeded without
            waiting for me &amp; that I shall soon
            have the pleasure of seeing your little
            Work in Print. -- X As to me, the fact
            is I have talked written &amp; thought<pb/>
            on the subject of Slavery till I can
            talk &amp; write no longer. A mighty
            work is accomplished as far as this
            Country is concerned. A mighty
            effect remains to be produced on
            the other side of the Atlantic. ^ [deletion of We? and ?] How many in England will
            wait &amp; watch the Result with
            intense anxiety &amp; interest! I only
            hope they will not forget how much
            they may contribute to its perfect
            success -- The more I hear &amp; read
            the more I am convinced that the<pb/>
            Negro Race are blessed with rather
            a peculiar aptitude for the
            reception of moral &amp; religious Instruc[-]
            tion, and it does seem to me that
            there never[?] was a stronger call on
            any nation than there is now on
            us to meet this inclination in
            them, to supply them amply
            with the means of Instruction
            to [deleted word?] dispath Missionaries; to institute
            Schools &amp; to send out Bibles --
            this is the only Compensation more<pb/>
            Power. &amp; it is an abundant one! [deletion]
            We may in this manner recompense
            all the sorrows &amp; sufferings we have
            inflicted &amp; be the means of making
            in the End, their barbarous Removal
            from their own [deleted word] Land. The
            greatest of blessings to them. [deleted: My]
            I am cheered indeed by hearing
            the note of Preparation on many
            sides. Various Denominations of
            Dissenters are preparing the
            Emissaries. The Church I trust<pb/>
            will not be behind &amp; the [deleted word: service?]
            Wilberforce Subscription which after
            the Erection of a monument is to
            be applied to some the foundation
            of some Institution in the West Indies
            which shall be a more appropriate
            Monument ^to Him than Marble, will
            trust be widely patronized X
            If -- dear Madam you can
            condescend to print into your Work
            as an extract from a letter the
            Paragraph I have placed between<pb/>
            crosses, you are of course at
            liberty. It is little worth while,
            but I am too much occupied to
            write a more formal Contribution</p>
