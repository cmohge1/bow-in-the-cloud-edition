               <l>"The young--the beautiful--the brave,"--</l>
               <l>The stone upon the White-man's grave</l>
               <l>  Had told us slumber nigh:--</l>
               <l>And why not here? Their darker hue</l>
               <l>  Upon the Negro's fortunes threw</l>
               <l>  As dark a destiny.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>They toiled, but not as others toil,</l>
               <l>  To gain from the productive soil</l>
               <l>  The wages of the free:</l>
               <l>The toil--the cord--the whip--were theirs--</l>
               <l>Their children's--call them not their heirs--</l>
               <l>  Heirs but of misery:--</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The gain was theirs who cooly tell</l>
               <l>  Of power, and will, and right to sell</l>
               <l>  The living form of man:--</l>
               <l>To trade in it, as they would trade</l>
               <l>In silks, and satins, and brocade,</l>
               <l>  And make just what they can:--</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>To point to form, and face, and limb,</l>
               <l>Not as the bounteous gifts of Him</l>
               <l>  Whose every work is good;</l>
               <l>But as mere items of account</l>
               <l>To swell or lessen the amount</l>
               <l>  Of money paid for blood.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And yet beneath this humble sod,</l>
               <l>Despised of men--beloved of God,</l>
               <l>  Full many a Slave's at rest:</l>
               <l>And at the last great day shall rise,</l>
               <l>  To claim their mansions in the skies,</l>
               <l>Their glory with the blest.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And in that day, amidst the crowd</l>
               <l>Of rich, and merciless, and proud,</l>
               <l>  Who laughed their chains to scorn,</l>
               <l>How many in the altered scene,</l>
               <l>Would even be as they had been,</l>
               <l>  Or never have been born.</l>
