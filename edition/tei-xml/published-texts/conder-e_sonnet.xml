        <lg>
          <l>With speed as of the ocean-wind there fled</l>
          <l>A shuddering captive from the impending stroke,</l>
          <l>Whose lash adds scorpions to the bondsman's yoke;</l>
          <l>And, gaining on his wild, despairing tread,</l>
          <l>That scorpion-lash was near. No pity woke</l>
          <l>For thee, lost fugitive! No refuge led</l>
          <l>To hope: there was no mercy to invoke;</l>
          <l>Nor faith for thee her sanctuary spread.</l>
          <l>Even at that latest moment, in his path,</l>
          <l>A child whose form the hues of England wore,</l>
          <l>The fainting victim saw. He stooped and bore</l>
          <l>Him in his arms: --then faced the avenger's wrath.</l>
          <l>His tyrants owned the eloquent appeal;</l>
          <l>And, with his pardon, stamped on Britain's power the seal.</l>
