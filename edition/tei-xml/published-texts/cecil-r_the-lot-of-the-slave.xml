            <lg>
               <l><span style="small-caps">Loved</span>, as a mother loves the babe she bore,</l>
               <l>Watches, toils, sighs, and loves it but the more,</l>
               <l>An infant negro, in the Western isles,</l>
               <l>Springs into life; -- the captive-mother smiles:</l>
               <l>For love will smile, however brief the joy;</l>
               <l>And her's is brief: -- O might she tend her boy!</l>
               <l>From nature's fountain due supplies to yield</l>
               <l>Might she but pause and quit the weary field!</l>
               <l>No: -- ere his birth, -- when fast her hour drew on,</l>
               <l>Burdened and faint, her task must yet be done,</l>
               <l>Short respite, short repose that frame must feel;</l>
               <l>Can she not stand to labour? -- she must <em>kneel</em>.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Some interval at length even avarice gave,</l>
               <l>In pity? -- nay; his <em>property</em> to save;</l>
               <l>But that is past, and she again must bear</l>
               <l>The sun, the lash, and to a stranger's care,</l>
               <l>(An aged negress for the field unfit,)</l>
               <l>Till day decline, her nurseling must commit;</l>
               <l>Nor dare a mother's fondness to express,</l>
               <l>Till nature droop, heart-sick with weariness.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Yet even thus, some comfort she derives</l>
               <l>From every sight of him; he grows, he thrives,</l>
               <l>Her hourly solace. Who -- what fiend could bear</l>
               <l>From her fond arm that one delight to tear?</l>
               <l>Ah! 'tis her owner's property, not her's,</l>
               <l>And avarice with soft pity ne'er confers.</l>
               <l>In want of gold, he sees a fit resource</l>
               <l>In that young slave, and with no more remorse,</l>
               <l>Or even less, than he who sells his horse,</l>
               <l>He names a sum, -- 'tis paid, -- the deed is done, --</l>
               <l>Tears, prayers, avail her not, -- the child is gone.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Frantic she shrieks, she howls in agony</l>
               <l>Around her master's dwelling. That shrill cry,</l>
               <l>Can he not silence it? -- it breaks his sleep;</l>
               <l>Is there no remedy? -- there is; -- the whip!</l>
               <l>This is the anodyne he deems the best,</l>
               <l>To soothe her spirit? -- no, -- to bring <em>him</em> rest.</l>
               <l>And from that hour, perchance, his court she trod</l>
               <l>In stillness, -- but "her cry went up to God."</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>He, the poor infant-victim, wept not long;</l>
               <l>Self-interest bade them show a thing so young</l>
               <l>Such tenderness as even the young of brutes</l>
               <l>Miss not, -- that care the owner's purpose suits;</l>
               <l>Though times there are, when cruelty's fell reign</l>
               <l>Hears even the voice of interest plead in vain;</l>
               <l>When gain, so fondly sought, less joy imparts,</l>
               <l>Than torturing human limbs and human hearts.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l><em>His</em> lot was milder, if it be more mild</l>
               <l>To spare a slave than slay him when a child:</l>
               <l>His childhood past, he grew a hardy boy,</l>
               <l>And entered early on a slave's employ;</l>
               <l>Early and long inured to daily pain,</l>
               <l>To dress the stubborn soil, and plant the cane;</l>
               <l>Dull, heartless, hopeless toil, that nought repays</l>
               <l>For all the waste of life's first, fairest days.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Smiling in beauty all the land may be,</l>
               <l>But can an eye enslaved that beauty see,</l>
               <l>Or seeing, taste? -- it smiles but on the free.</l>
               <l>Toiled he in hope, the thought of future gain</l>
               <l>Might nerve his soul long sorrow to sustain;</l>
               <l>Saw he in distant prospect, freedom's light,</l>
               <l>That beam, though faint, might cheer his aching sight;</l>
               <l>But should his hands, when resting from the field,</l>
               <l>Be active yet, and should the effort yield</l>
               <l>Some humble fruit -- precarious rights are his!</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>His little all a lawless <em>white</em> may seize,</l>
               <l>And if he dared defend it, with his life</l>
               <l>He pays the forfeit of that blameless strife.</l>
               <l>Or were he <em>freed</em>, unless the proof appear</l>
               <l>In every point indisputably clear,</l>
               <l>Though guiltless of a fault, his doom may be</l>
               <l>A fresh, remediless captivity.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But trained from childhood, William suffered not,</l>
               <l>In all their weight, the hardships of his lot;</l>
               <l>Stung by no memory of a happier day, --</l>
               <l>A Paradise for ever passed away, --</l>
               <l>Healthy and strong, his task accomplished well,</l>
               <l>On him the whip's dread vengeance rarely fell;</l>
               <l>Though through the gang oft sounds its fierce assault</l>
               <l>On all who loiter, -- feebleness their fault;</l>
               <l>And he not quite escaped, but his dark day</l>
               <l>Of misery had not dawned, -- 'twas on its way.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>It chanced among the females, one there was</l>
               <l>Whom William loved, for Nature's bounteous laws</l>
               <l>Even Slavery cannot wholly set aside;</l>
               <l>Their love was mutual; she became his bride,</l>
               <l>And in each other they were happy; true,</l>
               <l>The bonds were slightly knit that joined the two;</l>
               <l>The marriage covenant, if the owner please,</l>
               <l>Whatever rites have sealed it, vanishes.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But they were faithful, and 'twas their's to prove</l>
               <l>The sweetness first, and then the grief of love.</l>
               <l>Fanny, for William's sake, performed with zeal</l>
               <l>The allotted task, afraid lest he should feel</l>
               <l>The pang of sympathy, more keen, more deep</l>
               <l>Than even his own beneath the ruthless whip.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And love, long time, sustained her, but at length</l>
               <l>Failed to supply the want of firmer strength.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Just then, when first her energy declined,</l>
               <l>And scarce the hour of bitter need resigned,</l>
               <l>They tore him from her; such the master's will,</l>
               <l>The planter had another field to till;</l>
               <l>The husband gone, there yet remains the wife,</l>
               <l>Let her be sold, -- they need no woman's life.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Their master kind! -- if some few days of grief,</l>
               <l>And nights of anguish, brought them no relief;</l>
               <l>If woe thus wrung their hearts, 'twas soon to cease;</l>
               <l>Perchance he named some period of release;</l>
               <l>Some time -- should years of pain be well endured,</l>
               <l>When present trouble should be less deplored;</l>
               <l>For such events have happened! strange to say,</l>
               <l>Some owners have released their slaves, one day!</l>
