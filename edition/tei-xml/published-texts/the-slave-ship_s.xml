            <l>All are on board,--and for the favouring gale,</l>
            <l>To weigh the anchor, and to spread the sail,</l>
            <l>Alone they wait,--up springs a gentle breeze,</l>
            <l>And white waves ripple o'er the clear blue seas;</l>
            <l>High on the deck, the impatient captain stands,</l>
            <l>And gives the word to weigh for distant lands;</l>
            <l>In deepening tones the seamen shout "Unmoor,"</l>
            <l>The cheerful cry re-echoes to the shore;</l>
            <l>The gathering winds now gently fill the sails,</l>
            <l>The streamers flutter in the welcome gales.</l>
            <l>What Briton's voice but eager now inquires,</l>
            <l>(While glows his heart with all a patriot's fires,)</l>
            <l>"Is it to meet the foe upon the wave,</l>
            <l>To whelm him there, and Albion to save,</l>
            <l>Yon vessel seeks the main? Are you the crew</l>
            <l>Whose hands are mighty, and whose hearts are true?</l>
            <l>Is yon the bark that bears upon the breeze,</l>
            <l>Britannia's thunder, o'er Britannia's seas?</l>
            <l>A patriot's blessing rest upon her sails,</l>
            <l>And prosperous wishes strengthen all her gales;</l>
            <l>May glorious conquest crown her virtuous toil!"--</l>
            <l>--Oh! cease thy wishes, 'tis for human spoil</l>
            <l>Yon demons seek the flood, and be those sails</l>
            <l>Adversely wafted,--shivered by those gales!</l>
            <l>Upon yon deck no virtuous chieftain stands,</l>
            <l>Nor does he hold command o'er gallant bands;</l>
            <l>Not for his country drawn his righteous sword,</l> 
            <l>Not for his country are the deeps explored,</l>
            <l>No patriot's wishes waft him from the shores,</l>
            <l>For him the fort no parting volley pours;</l>
            <l>Scorned and detested by his fellow-men,</l>
            <l>The worst of monsters and yon bark his den.</l>
