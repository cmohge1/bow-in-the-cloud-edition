               <l>Of all, whose tributary rhyme</l>
               <l>In Freedom's cause you crave;</l>
               <l>Yet, for my subject's sake, excuse</l>
               <l>The long delay, and lowly muse:</l>
               <l>'Tis Wilberforce's Grave.</l>
            </lg>
            
            <lg>
               <l>Auspicious year! in whose short span</l>
               <l>To saints on high and captive man</l>
               <l>Two choicest boons were given:</l>
               <l>While Freedom wings her speediest flight</l>
               <l>To tribes immured in Slavery's night,</l>
               <l>Her champion soars to Heaven.</l>
            </lg>
            
            <lg>
               <l>How glowed that breast, now cold in death,</l>
               <l>How from those lips once flowed a breath</l>
               <l>Could listening senates move,</l>
               <l>Could still each sneer, could quell each strife</l>
               <l>Speak ye, who prized him in his life,</l>
               <l>And still his ashes love!</l>
            </lg>
            
            <lg>
               <l>For lo! his obsequies to grace,</l>
               <l>The noblest of the British race</l>
               <l>At Britain's call appear;</l>
               <l>Hushed are the storms of loud debate,</l>
               <l>While, midst the ashes of the Great,</l>
               <l>Descends a Patriot's <note>bier</note>.</l>

               <l>The Throne, the Church, their tribute yield;</l>
               <l>The Bar, the Senate, and the Field,</l>
               <l>Their varied honours blend;</l>
               <l>See <hi rend="small-caps">Howley's</hi> meekness, <hi rend="small-caps">Wellesley's</hi> might,</l>
               <l><hi rend="small-caps">Eldon</hi>, the prop of ancient right,</l>

               <l>Conspicuous, on his native coast,</l>
               <l>The storied obelisk shall boast</l>
               <l>The first-fruits of his <note>fame</note>;</l>
               <l>And shew to each adventurous youth,</l>
               <l>That glory crowns the paths of truth,</l>
               <l>And guards the Patriot's name.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>Yet has he won a nobler prize!</l>
               <l>A ransomed native of the skies,</l>
               <l>He lays his laurels down,</l>
               <l>Where, robed in Heaven's immortal dress,</l>
               <l>He boasts a Saviour's righteousness,</l>
               <l>And wears a blood-bought crown.</l>
