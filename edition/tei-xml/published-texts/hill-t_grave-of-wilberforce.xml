               <l>Of all, whose tributary rhyme</l>
               <l>In Freedom's cause you crave;&nbsp;</l>
               <l>Yet, for my subject's sake, excuse&nbsp;</l>

               <l>Auspicious year! in whose short span&nbsp;</l>
               <l>To saints on high and captive man</l>
               <l>Two choicest boons were given:</l>
               <l>While Freedom wings her speediest flight&nbsp;</l>
               <l>To tribes immured in Slavery's night,</l>
               <l>Her champion soars to Heaven.</l>

               <l>How glowed that breast, now cold in death,&shy;&nbsp;</l>
               <l>How from those lips once flowed a breath</l>
               <l>Could listening senates move,</l>
               <l>Could still each sneer, could quell each strife&shy;&nbsp;</l>
               <l>Speak ye, who prized him in his life,</l>
               <l>And still his ashes love!</l>

               <l>The noblest of the British race</l>
               <l>At Britain's call appear;</l>
               <l>Hushed are the storms of loud debate,&nbsp;</l>
               <l>While, midst the ashes of the Great,</l>
               <l>Descends a Patriot's <note>bier</note>.</l>

               <l>And shew to each adventurous youth,&nbsp;</l>
               <l>That glory crowns the paths of truth,&nbsp;</l>
               <l>And guards the Patriot's name.</l>

               <l>Yet has he won a nobler prize!&nbsp;</l>
               <l>A ransomed native of the skies,&nbsp;</l>
               <l>He lays his laurels down,</l>
               <l>Where, robed in Heaven's immortal dress,&nbsp;</l>
               <l>He boasts a Saviour's righteousness,</l>
               <l>And wears a blood-bought crown.</l>
