        <lg>
          <l>I thank my God and yours, my blessed ones,</l>
          <l>That you were not born slaves; I'll tell you how</l>
          <l>A little negro babe grew sick and died</l>
          <l>Without its mother near it.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>––She laid him down-and as a bird</l>
          <l>Struck with a mortal dart, she reeled,</l>
          <l>Yet dared not look again,––she beard</l>
          <l>The last, long summons to the field.</l>
          <l>She laid him down,––the only one,</l>
          <l>Her hope, her love dwelt fondly on.</l>
          <l>The only heart that hers had met</l>
          <l>With joy, and turned from with regret.</l>
          <l>A golden link in slavery's chain,</l>
          <l>The manna on life's desert plain,</l>
          <l>Which, through the weary day and night,</l>
          <l>Made slumber bliss, and labour light.</l>
          <l>All pain was hers the slave could know,</l>
          <l>Hard toil and insult, taunt and blow;</l>
          <l>Yet had her bright-eyed negro child,</l>
          <l>Almost to slavery reconciled</l>
          <l>Her spirit, for his smiles could bring</l>
          <l>Lost pleasures to her soul, and bliss</l>
          <l>From out his love burst, like a spring,</l>
          <l>That gladdens the parched wilderness.</l>
          <l>And toiling 'neath the scorching sun,</l>
          <l>She thought but how, when day was done,</l>
          <l>Sitting beside the plantain tree,</l>
          <l>Clasping his little playful band,</l>
          <l>Or joining in his thoughtless glee,</l>
          <l>The mother's fondness might expand;</l>
          <l>And, thrilling like a finer sense,</l>
          <l>Be for all pain a recompence.</l>
          <l>––A burning fever came at length,</l>
          <l>And bowed his frame, consumed his strength;</l>
          <l>And wild throbs of delirious pain</l>
          <l>Filled with alarms his infant brain.</l>
          <l>He clasped his mother's neck and prayed,</l>
          <l>Madly and mournfully, for aid.</l>
          <l>But vain his prayer,––she might not stay</l>
          <l>To watch beside him through the day.</l>
          <l>'Twas harvest-time, when she must bear</l>
          <l>Of toil and task, a heavier share,</l>
          <l>So, sleepless through the night, she sat</l>
          <l>Watching beside her infant's mat,</l>
          <l>And with untiring love,</l>
          <l>Bent o'er him,––soothed and wiled away</l>
          <l>The fears that made his brain a prey;</l>
          <l>And bathed his brow, and strove</l>
          <l>To please him with each thing she knew</l>
          <l>He loved when he was strong;</l>
          <l>The tale that oft his wonder drew,</l>
          <l>His favourite sport and song.</l>
          <l>To lay his little cheek to hers,</l>
          <l>And his burning breath to feel,</l>
          <l>To hear the feeble plaint that stirs</l>
          <l>The heartstrings like love's last appeal.</l>
          <l>––But day was up-the toil begun––</l>
          <l>And she must go forth with her fettered race.</l>
          <l>What heeds the white man, though her son</l>
          <l>Be tom from her embrace,</l>
          <l>And left to die, of deaths the worst,</l>
          <l>In agonies of burning thirst?</l>
          <l>What is a negro-infant's sorrow</l>
          <l>To him?––a mother's wild distress;</l>
          <l>Her groan of utter wretchedness,</l>
          <l>Or look of frenzied horror?––</l>
          <l>She must away to till the bane</l>
          <l>Of her dark race, the blood-nursed cane.</l>
          <l>So she laid him down, and forth she went</l>
          <l>With a mother's outraged feelings wild,</l>
          <l>And as the fiery sunbeams spent</l>
          <l>Her frame, not of the scorching ray</l>
          <l>She thought, but only how the day,</l>
          <l>Hour after hour, might wear away</l>
          <l>With her poor abandoned child.</l>
          <l>All day she toiled––at night she sped</l>
          <l>To her hut, and there he lay––</l>
          <l>But cold and stiff, on his dreamless bed,</l>
          <l>Where life had passed away!</l>
          <l>Alas! for that poor mother's wail,</l>
          <l>When she saw his cheek all wet with tears;</l>
          <l>And thought what anguish would assail</l>
          <l>His soul, when pangs and fears</l>
          <l>Came o'er him, and he called in vain</l>
          <l>On the only one who was dear to him;</l>
          <l>Who could have soothed his dying pain,</l>
          <l>And blessed him ere his eyes grew dim,</l>
          <l>––At length she calmed her grief and laid</l>
          <l>Her infant in the plantain's shade;</l>
          <l>And, as if lulling him to rest,</l>
          <l>Began a lowly warbled strain;</l>
          <l>For she knew in death the child was blest,</l>
          <l>And freed from the white man's chain;––</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>&quot;My little one! my blessed one!</l>
          <l>Would I were laid with thee!</l>
          <l>Would that my limbs were fetterless</l>
          <l>In lands beyond the sea.</l>
          <l>Would I could burst life's long dark dream,</l>
          <l>And be where thou art now,</l>
          <l>Where cool gales from my native stream</l>
          <l>Are freshening o'er thy brow.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>&quot;Thou art there! thou art there!</l>
          <l>I see thee stand On our broad river's shore;</l>
          <l>Thy father clasps thy little hand,</l>
          <l>And you are slaves no more.</l>
          <l>Tell him, thou dear, thou happy one,</l>
          <l>Though I wear the white man's chain,</l>
          <l>My galling task will soon be done,</l>
          <l>And we all shall meet again.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>&quot;We all shall meet again, and see,</l>
          <l>In the towering lolo's shade,</l>
          <l>Our children sporting joyfully</l>
          <l>Where we in childhood played.­</l>
          <l>My child, I will not mourn for thee;</l>
          <l>Your shouts are echoing wide,</l>
          <l>In the broad shade of the lolo tree,</l>
          <l>On our own river's side.&quot;</l>
