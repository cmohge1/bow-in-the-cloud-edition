          <label>I.</label>
        
        <lg>
          <l>My native land! far o'er the sea,</l>
          <l>Enslaved and sad, I think of thee,</l>
          <l>When, free as the unbridled breeze,</l>
          <l>I chased the deer 'mongst spicy trees,</l>
          <l>And stayed, amidst his fleet career,</l>
          <l>The ostrich, with my swifter spear.</l>
          <l>Then bright of look--as sun at noon,</l>
          <l>Then gay of heart-as bird in June,</l>
          <l>And careless as the lark that flies,</l>
          <l>With song to bid the morn arise,</l>
          <l>I rose in gladness, breast and brow</l>
          <l>Fearless and free,--how rise I now ?</l>
        </lg>
    
          <label>II.</label>
        
        <lg>
          <l>How rise I?--my heart throbs to ask;</l>
          <l>See, there's the whip, and here's the task;</l>
          <l>Nor toil alone enchafes my mood,</l>
          <l>My taxed and burthened soul sweats blood;</l>
          <l>My heart leaps up in arms,--the brand</l>
          <l>Smites sharp in an insulted hand.</l>
          <l>This golden clime, in vain for me,</l>
          <l>Pours liquid fragrance from the tree,--</l>
          <l>The fruits which cool men's lips at noon,</l>
          <l>The preacher's prayers beneath the moon,</l>
          <l>Are vain,--my trampled heart, in truth,</l>
          <l>Nor food can cheer, nor words can soothe.</l>
        </lg>
      
          <label>III.</label>
        
        <lg>
          <l>I heard a voice far o'er the waves,</l>
          <l>Cry, &quot;Greece had serfs and Rome had slaves;</l>
          <l>See, swarthy Spain is doomed to pine,</l>
          <l>'Neath slavery thrice as fierce as thine;</l>
          <l>Gay France her rosy vintage quaffs</l>
          <l>In fetters,--yet she leaps and laughs;</l>
          <l>Wide Russia's rude and savage horde</l>
          <l>Own for their law the sharpest sword;</l>
          <l>Colombia from her slave the cup</l>
          <l>Of freedom takes, and drinks it up;足</l>
          <l>Lo, one fair island 'midst the main !足</l>
          <l>Go touch it,--and off drops thy chain.&quot;</l>
        </lg>
      
          <label>IV.</label>
        
        <lg>
          <l>'Tis true,--'tis true,--yet Britons born</l>
          <l>Still bid me taste the cup they scorn;</l>
          <l>Men who in court, and flood, and field,</l>
          <l>For freedom wear the sword and shield;</l>
          <l>To save the weak, and strike the strong,</l>
          <l>Has been green England's motto long.</l>
          <l>I've said my say,--I've moan'd my moan,足</l>
          <l>Yet one word more,--one word alone;足</l>
          <l>My wedded love! far o'er the deep,</l>
          <l>Livest thou, to think of me and weep?</l>
          <l>My darling boy,--my one sweet child,</l>
          <l>I saw thee late in sleep, and smiled,--</l>
          <l>I saw thee in my dreams,--'tis sweet</l>
          <l>To see them there,--we ne'er shall meet.</l>
