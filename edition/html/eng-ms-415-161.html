In pursu= <br />ance of this determination I was compelled, some time ago, to refuse the <br />request of Dr. Montgomery that I would write something for his work in <br />aid of the Chimney Sweepers -- a work, which both from by admiration <br />of the Editor's genius, and by interest in the benevolent object he had in <br />view, I should have been most happy to assist to the utmost of my power. <br />This will, I trust, be a sufficient apology for the necessity which <br />I find myself under of adopting the same conduct with respect to you.</p><div class="closer">I have the honour to be your much <br /> obliged Servant <div class="signed">Thomas Moore</div></div></div></body></html>
