<p><strong>Note: </strong>Edward William Barnard was a divine, poet and scholar. Nephew of fellow abolitionist,
  <br />the Archdeacon Francis Wrangham. &#39;He was educated at Harrow and Trinity College, owing
  <br />to his distaste for mathematics. In 1817 he published anonymously, &#39;Poems, founded
  <br />upon the Poems of Meleager,&#39; which were re-edited in 1818 under the title of &#39;Trifles,
  <br />imitative of the Chaster Style of Meleager.&#39; The latter volume was dedicated to Thomas
  <br />Moore, who tells us in his journal that he had the manuscript to look over, and describes
  <br />the poems as &#39;done with much elegance.&#39; Barnard was presented to the living of Brantingthorp,
  <br />Yorkshire, from which is dated his next publication, &#39;The Protestant Beadsman&#39; (1822),
  <br />This is described by a writer in &#39;Notes and Queries&#39; as a &#39;delightful little volume
  <br />on the saints and martyrs commemorated by the English church, containing biographical
  <br />notices of them, and hymns upon each of them.&rsquo; Barnard died prematurely on 10 Jan.

<p><strong>Note: </strong>James Douglas came from a long line of Scottish nobles dating back to Sir James Douglas, who fought with Robert the Bruce during the Scottish Wars of Independence. Douglas was the eighteenth in descent from Archibald, second son of James, second Earl of Douglas, who was killed at the battle of Otterburn, 21st July, 1388. He was born on 9 October 1790 at Cavers, near Hawick, Roxburghshire, and died there on 17 August 1861. He became laird of Cavers on the death of his father in 1815. He published on philosophy, religion, politics and history, and was a staunch opponent of slavery. In 1833 he published his &#39;Address on Slavery&#39; (Edinburgh: Adam and Charles Black; and London: Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown, Green and Longman, 1833), which argued for the economic costs of slavery and empire. His intention was to broaden the appeal to those who could oppose slavery on utilitarian rather than moral principles.

<p><strong>Note: </strong>The Reverend James Everett (1784-1872) was a Methodist minister and writer from Manchester. He was born in 1784 at Alnwick in Northumberland. At an early period he formed the habit of taking careful notes of the celebrated characters whom he met, and thus preserved recollections of Robert Southey, poet laureate, James Montgomery, William Dawson, and many others. He was subject to criticism and eventual expulsion from the Methodist Conference (the highest legislative authority in the Methodist Church) in 1849. Expelled because he wrote critical pamphlets against the hierarchy, Everett continued his agitation, and became a prolific author and prime mover in the formation of a new sect in 1857, &lsquo;The United Methodist Free Church&rsquo;.

He emigrated to South Africa, and he is remembered chiefly as a poet of that country. His Ephemerides (1828) and African Sketches (1834) reveal his sympathetic interest in the native races and the wildlife of Africa. He became the secretary of the London Anti-slavery Society in 1827. In 1834, the year the Slavery Abolition Act was passed, he died of consumption.

<p><strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong>Maria Stevens was known for religious writings, instruction, and community work in Knaresborough, Yorkshire. In 1840 Stevens left an endowment to the school to provide bibles for an annual prize. She was the carver Samuel Fisher&#39;s second daughter. She was married to Lawrence Stevens of Swaffham and Knaresborough (son of Admiral Stevens); they had two children, who both died young. Her sister, Elizabeth, was married to the Rev. Andrew Cheap, Rector of Elvington and Knaresborough; he was probably responsible for the fact that the Fisher workshop produced so many monuments for Christ Church in Harrogate (Poppy Corita Myerscough, &#39;The Fishers of York&#39;. PhD Dissertation, University of York, 1996). She belonged to St John the Baptist Church, Knaresborough. She died in 1840 and, according to her memorial in the Parish Church, &#39;laboured with unwearied zeal and love for the spiritual benefit of the people of this place&#39;. William Stubbs, bishop of Oxford, recalled, &#39;Mrs. Stevens, a name deeply beloved in the town, gave Bible lessons in a little room off Kirkgate, near the station, and there he constantly attended. &quot;I do not suppose any one was ever more beloved than she&quot;, he said in after years; and when he preached in 1872 at the parish church after its restoration, he recalled the &quot;most gracious presence, inseparable from the history of this place, not to be forgotten the commanding eye, and noble figure; the sweet and most eloquent voice; the wonderful hold on Scripture in the spirit and the letter; the marvellous industry that poured forth book after book, illustration after illustration, all the time teaching continuously and continually; nursing the sick, comforting the dying and the sinner, guiding the little ones, foremost in every good work; all with a zeal, a power, an energy that made her a very exception to all the rules that bind the life of Englishwomen, and withal the most sympathetic, the most kindly, the wisest counsellor we ever knew.&quot;&#39; (<a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/williamstubbsbis00hutt/page/n7/mode/2up">William Stubbs, bishop of Oxford, 1825-1901 : (From the letters of William Stubbs)</a>.

<p><strong>Note: </strong>Lucy Townsend (née Jesse) was a British abolitionist. Born in West Bromwich July 1781, Lucy Jesse was the daughter of Reverend William Jesse, incumbent at All Saints Church from 1790 to 1814. She married Rev. Charles Townsend, curate of West Bromwich, in 1807. He became vicar in 1815 until 1836. She started the first Ladies&#39; Anti-Slavery Society in Birmingham, called the Birmingham Ladies Society for the Relief of Negro Slaves. Townsend&#39;s organisation was not affiliated to any national organisation, nor was it a partner organisation for Birmingham&#39;s male Anti-Slavery Organisation. Rawson&#39;s Sheffield organisation was the first Anti-Slavery organisation in Britain to propose an immediate end to slavery. Townsend&#39;s organisation took a more conservative view in 1839 when they followed the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society&#39;s policy of supporting a more gradual move.
